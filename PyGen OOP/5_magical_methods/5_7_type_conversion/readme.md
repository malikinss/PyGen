This lesson has good theory explonation, 3 programing practical tasks and 8 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 5_7_1_Vector

```
# Vector Class Plane Coordinate Converter
The `Vector` class encapsulates a 2D vector defined by `x` and `y` coordinates, offering a concise informal string representation as `(<x>, <y>)`.
It supports type casting to `bool` (nonzero check), `int` (integer magnitude), `float` (real magnitude), and `complex` (x + yi), leveraging the vector’s properties to provide meaningful conversions without altering its core structure.
This class is tailored for geometric applications, educational demonstrations of type casting in Python, or scenarios requiring versatile vector representations, such as graphics programming or mathematical modeling where vectors need to interact with different data types seamlessly.

2. 5_7_2_Temperature

```
# Temperature Class Celsius Converter
The `Temperature` class encapsulates a temperature value in degrees Celsius, initialized with a single numeric argument.
It provides a method to convert to Fahrenheit, a class method to create instances from Fahrenheit, and an informal string representation formatted to two decimal places with a °C suffix.
Additionally, it supports casting to `bool` (true if above zero), `int` (integer part), and `float` (real number), making it a versatile tool for temperature-related computations.
This class is designed for temperature manipulation and conversion, ideal for applications in weather forecasting, scientific calculations, or educational settings to demonstrate Python’s type casting and class methods.
Its straightforward interface allows seamless integration into programs needing to handle Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, with flexible type conversions for varied use cases.
