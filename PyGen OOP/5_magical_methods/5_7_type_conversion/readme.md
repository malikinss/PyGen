```
# Vector Class Plane Coordinate Converter
The `Vector` class encapsulates a 2D vector defined by `x` and `y` coordinates, offering a concise informal string representation as `(<x>, <y>)`.
It supports type casting to `bool` (nonzero check), `int` (integer magnitude), `float` (real magnitude), and `complex` (x + yi), leveraging the vectorâ€™s properties to provide meaningful conversions without altering its core structure.
This class is tailored for geometric applications, educational demonstrations of type casting in Python, or scenarios requiring versatile vector representations, such as graphics programming or mathematical modeling where vectors need to interact with different data types seamlessly.
