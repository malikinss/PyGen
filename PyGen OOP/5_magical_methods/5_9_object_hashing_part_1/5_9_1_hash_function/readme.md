# hash_function Custom Object Hasher

## Description üìù

The `hash_function` computes a custom hash value for any object by processing its string representation through a three-step algorithm.
First, it calculates the sum of products of symmetrically paired characters‚Äô Unicode values (first with last, second with second-to-last, etc.), adding the middle character for odd-length strings.
Second, it computes an alternating weighted sum of Unicode values multiplied by their 1-based positions.
Finally, it multiplies these two results and takes the modulus with `123456791`, returning the final hash as an integer.

## Purpose üéØ

This function is designed for generating consistent hash values for objects, suitable for custom hashing in data structures, testing unique object signatures, or educational exercises exploring hash algorithms.
Its unique combination of symmetric pairing and alternating weights makes it a distinctive tool for applications needing deterministic yet complex hash computations, such as checksums or lightweight object fingerprinting.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Input Processing**: Converts the input `obj` to a string using `str(obj)` to ensure a consistent character sequence, regardless of the object‚Äôs type.
-   **Step 1: Symmetric Product Sum (`symmetric_sum`)**:
    -   Iterates over indices `i` from 0 to `n//2` (half the string length, floored).
    -   For each `i`, multiplies the Unicode value of the character at `s[i]` (`ord(s[i])`) by the Unicode value of the character at `s[-(i+1)]` (symmetric position from the end).
    -   Sums these products to form the total.
    -   If the string length `n` is odd, adds the Unicode value of the middle character (`ord(s[n//2])`) without multiplication, as it has no pair.
-   **Step 2: Weighted Alternating Sum (`weighted_sum`)**:
    -   Iterates over the string‚Äôs characters with their indices `i` (0-based).
    -   For each character `c` at index `i`, computes `ord(c) * (i + 1) * (-1 if i % 2 else 1)`, alternating signs (`+` for even `i`, `-` for odd `i`) and weighting by position (1-based).
    -   Sums these terms to produce the alternating weighted sum.
-   **Step 3: Final Hash**:
    -   Multiplies the results of Step 1 (`symmetric_sum`) and Step 2 (`weighted_sum`).
    -   Applies the modulus operator `% 123456791` to keep the result within a fixed range, ensuring a consistent integer output.
-   **Output**: Returns the final integer hash value, which is deterministic for the same string input, providing a unique signature based on the algorithm‚Äôs structure.

## Usage üì¶

1. **Save the Code**: Store the `hash_function` in a Python file, e.g., `hash_function.py`, containing only the function definition for submission to a testing system, as no calling code is allowed.
2. **Apply in Context**: Use in scenarios requiring custom hashing, such as:
    - Creating unique identifiers for objects in a hash table.
    - Comparing complex objects by their hash values in testing.
    - Experimenting with hash-based algorithms in academic settings.
3. **Test Cases (Not for Submission)**: If testing locally, try inputs like:
    ```python
    print(hash_function("abc"))     # Computes hash for "abc"
    print(hash_function(123))       # Computes hash for "123"
    print(hash_function(""))        # Computes hash for "" (returns 0)
    ```
4. **Explore Flexibility**: Input various objects (strings, numbers, lists) to observe how their string representations influence the hash, noting that the function handles empty strings (yielding 0) and complex inputs consistently.

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `hash_function` provides a sophisticated yet efficient way to generate custom hash values in Python, combining symmetric character pairing with an alternating weighted sum to produce a unique integer signature for any object.
Its three-step algorithm‚Äîproduct summation, alternating weighting, and modular multiplication‚Äîensures a deterministic and intricate hash suitable for diverse applications, from data indexing to algorithm design.
The implementation is concise, leveraging Python‚Äôs `ord()` for Unicode values and list comprehensions for clarity, while the modulus operation keeps outputs manageable.
This function shines in educational contexts, illustrating how hashing can be tailored to specific needs, and in practical scenarios requiring robust object differentiation.
While already complete, it could be extended with features like handling custom string encodings or adjusting the modulus for different ranges, but its current form fully meets the task‚Äôs requirements with precision and elegance, ready to power any project needing a custom hashing solution.
