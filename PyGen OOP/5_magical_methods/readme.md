1. 5_1_objects_creation_initialization_clearing

```
# Lesson 5.1: Creation, Initialization, and Clearing of Objects 🛠️
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods in Python
-   The **`new()`** and **`init()`** magic methods
-   Singleton design pattern implementation
-   The **`del()`** magic method for object deletion
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how Python creates and initializes objects using `new()` and `init()`
✅ Implement the **Singleton** pattern to ensure a class has only one instance
✅ Learn how to manage object lifecycle using `del()`
✅ Be able to apply these concepts to optimize code for object creation and clearing
```

2. 5_2_objects_string_representation

```
# Lesson 5.2: String Representation of Objects 📜
This lesson covers:
-   Functions **`str()`** and **`repr()`** in Python
-   Magic methods **`__str__()`** and **`__repr__()`**
-   Formal and informal string representations of objects
-   Practical implementation across various classes
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 6 programming practical tasks, and 11 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between **`str()`** and **`repr()`** functions
✅ Implement **`__str__()`** and **`__repr__()`** magic methods for custom string representations
✅ Learn to create formal (developer-friendly) and informal (user-friendly) object descriptions
✅ Apply these concepts to real-world class examples for better object management
```

3. 5_3_objects_comparison

```
# Lesson 5.3: Comparison of Objects ⚖️
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods **`__eq__()`** and **`__ne__()`** for equality and inequality
-   The **`NotImplemented`** constant for unsupported comparisons
-   Magic methods **`__lt__()`** and **`__gt__()`** for less than and greater than
-   Magic methods **`__le__()`** and **`__ge__()`** for less than or equal and greater than or equal
-   The **`@total_ordering`** decorator for complete comparison support
-   Practical implementation of object comparison
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 4 programming practical tasks, and 14 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to implement object comparison using magic methods
✅ Use **`NotImplemented`** to handle invalid comparison cases
✅ Apply **`@total_ordering`** to simplify comparison logic
✅ Be able to compare objects in practical scenarios like vectors, words, dates, and versions
