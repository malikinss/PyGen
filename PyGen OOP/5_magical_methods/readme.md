1. 5_1_objects_creation_initialization_clearing

```
# Lesson 5.1: Creation, Initialization, and Clearing of Objects 🛠️
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods in Python
-   The **`new()`** and **`init()`** magic methods
-   Singleton design pattern implementation
-   The **`del()`** magic method for object deletion
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how Python creates and initializes objects using `new()` and `init()`
✅ Implement the **Singleton** pattern to ensure a class has only one instance
✅ Learn how to manage object lifecycle using `del()`
✅ Be able to apply these concepts to optimize code for object creation and clearing
```

2. 5_2_objects_string_representation

```
# Lesson 5.2: String Representation of Objects 📜
This lesson covers:
-   Functions **`str()`** and **`repr()`** in Python
-   Magic methods **`__str__()`** and **`__repr__()`**
-   Formal and informal string representations of objects
-   Practical implementation across various classes
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 6 programming practical tasks, and 11 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between **`str()`** and **`repr()`** functions
✅ Implement **`__str__()`** and **`__repr__()`** magic methods for custom string representations
✅ Learn to create formal (developer-friendly) and informal (user-friendly) object descriptions
✅ Apply these concepts to real-world class examples for better object management
```

3. 5_3_objects_comparison

```
# Lesson 5.3: Comparison of Objects ⚖️
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods **`__eq__()`** and **`__ne__()`** for equality and inequality
-   The **`NotImplemented`** constant for unsupported comparisons
-   Magic methods **`__lt__()`** and **`__gt__()`** for less than and greater than
-   Magic methods **`__le__()`** and **`__ge__()`** for less than or equal and greater than or equal
-   The **`@total_ordering`** decorator for complete comparison support
-   Practical implementation of object comparison
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 4 programming practical tasks, and 14 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to implement object comparison using magic methods
✅ Use **`NotImplemented`** to handle invalid comparison cases
✅ Apply **`@total_ordering`** to simplify comparison logic
✅ Be able to compare objects in practical scenarios like vectors, words, dates, and versions
```

4. 5_4_unary_operators_anf_functions

```
# Lesson 5.4: Unary Operators and Functions ➕➖
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods **`__pos__()`**, **`__neg__()`**, and **`__invert__()`** for unary operators
-   Magic methods **`__abs__()`**, **`__round__()`**, and similar functions
-   Practical implementation of unary operations on objects
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 5 programming practical tasks, and 8 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to implement unary operators using magic methods
✅ Use **`__abs__()`** and **`__round__()`** to extend object functionality
✅ Apply unary operations to manipulate objects in practical scenarios
✅ Be able to overload operators for custom behavior in classes
```

5. 5_5_arithmetic_operations

```
# Lesson 5.5: Arithmetic Operations 🧮
This lesson covers:
-   Magic methods **`__add__()`**, **`__sub__()`**, and **`__mul__()`** for basic arithmetic
-   Magic methods **`__truediv__()`**, **`__floordiv__()`**, and **`__mod__()`** for division and modulo
-   Reflected arithmetic operations (e.g., handling `scalar * obj`)
-   In-place magic methods **`__iadd__()`**, **`__isub__()`**, **`__imul__()`**, **`__itruediv__()`**, **`__ifloordiv__()`**, and **`__imod__()`**
-   Practical implementation of arithmetic operations on objects
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 5 programming practical tasks, and 14 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to implement arithmetic operations using magic methods
