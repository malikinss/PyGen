TODO:
    An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet
    or a local network.

    IP addresses are a set of four integers separated by periods.

    For example, 192.158.1.38.

    Each number in the set belongs to the interval from 0 to 255.

    Thus, the full range of IP addresses is addresses:
        from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

    Implement the IPAddress class, which describes an IP address.

    When instantiated, the class must accept one argument:
        - ipaddress â€” an IP address, represented as one of the following:
            1. a string of four integers separated by dots
            2. a list or tuple of four integers

    An instance of the IPAddress class must have the following formal string
    representation:
        IPAddress('<IP address as four integers separated by dots>')

    And the following informal string representation:
        <IP address as four integers separated by dots>

NOTE:
    No additional data validation is required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of the IPAddress
    class, it can be arbitrary.
