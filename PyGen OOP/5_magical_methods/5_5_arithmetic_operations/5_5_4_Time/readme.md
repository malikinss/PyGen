# Time Class Clock Simulator

## Description 📝

The `Time` class represents time on a digital clock, taking `hours` and `minutes` as input and normalizing them (24-hour cycle for hours, 60-minute cycle for minutes).
It provides an informal string representation in `HH:MM` format and supports addition (`+` for new instance, `+=` for in-place) with other `Time` instances, returning `NotImplemented` for invalid operands.

## Purpose 🎯

This class is designed for time manipulation, suitable for scheduling, educational examples of operator overloading, or applications needing clock arithmetic.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Initialization**: Converts `hours` and `minutes` to total minutes, then normalizes to `hours % 24` and `minutes % 60`.
-   **`__str__`()**: Formats time as `HH:MM` with leading zeros using `:02d`.
-   **`__add__`()**: Adds two `Time` instances by summing total minutes and creating a new normalized instance.
-   **`__iadd__`()**: Updates `self` in-place by adding another `Time` instance’s minutes and normalizing.
-   **Helper Function**: `get_total_minutes()` computes total minutes for consistency.
-   **Error Handling**: Returns `NotImplemented` for non-`Time` operands.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the class in a Python file, e.g., `time.py`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run Python and test the class:

```python
from time import Time
t1 = Time(23, 50)
t2 = Time(1, 20)
print(t1)          # 23:50
print(t1 + t2)     # 01:10
t1 += t2
print(t1)          # 01:10
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `Time` class offers a clean and practical way to handle clock time in Python, with normalized arithmetic and formatted output.
Its design is robust, making it a solid base for adding features like subtraction or time differences for more advanced timekeeping tasks.
