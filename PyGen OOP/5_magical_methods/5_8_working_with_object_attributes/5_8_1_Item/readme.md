# Item Class Product Descriptor

## Description üìù

The `Item` class models a product with attributes for `name`, `price`, and `quantity`, accepting these as arguments during instantiation.
It ensures the `name` attribute is returned with a capital letter (title case) and provides a `total` attribute that computes the product of `price` and `quantity` dynamically.
This implementation corrects an assumed faulty prior version by properly handling attribute access to meet the specified requirements.

## Purpose üéØ

This class is designed for inventory or e-commerce scenarios, enabling easy tracking of item details and their total cost.
It‚Äôs suitable for retail applications, educational examples of custom attribute access in Python, or any context where products need to be represented with dynamic calculations, such as shopping carts or stock management systems.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Takes three arguments:
    -   `name` (string): Stored as `_name` to avoid conflicts with custom attribute handling.
    -   `price` (integer or float): Stored directly as `self.price` for the item‚Äôs cost per unit.
    -   `quantity` (integer): Stored as `self.quantity` for the number of items.
-   **Custom Attribute Access (`__getattribute__`)**: Overrides Python‚Äôs default attribute retrieval to provide special behavior:
    -   For `name`: Retrieves `_name` using `object.__getattribute__` to avoid recursion, then returns it in title case (e.g., `apple` becomes `Apple`).
    -   For `total`: Computes and returns `price * quantity` dynamically, accessing `price` and `quantity` via `object.__getattribute__` to ensure correct resolution.
    -   For other attributes: Delegates to `object.__getattribute__` for standard behavior, ensuring `price`, `quantity`, or any other attributes are accessible as stored.
-   **Safety**: Uses `object.__getattribute__` to prevent infinite recursion when accessing attributes within `__getattribute__`, a critical consideration for custom attribute handling.

## Usage üì¶

1. **Save the Code**: Place the `Item` class in a Python file, e.g., `item.py`, for use in programs or submission to a testing system.
2. **Create and Test Items**: Instantiate items and access their attributes to verify behavior:
    ```python
    from item import Item
    item = Item('apple', 10.5, 3)
    print(item.name)     # Apple
    print(item.total)    # 31.5
    print(item.price)    # 10.5
    print(item.quantity) # 3
    item2 = Item('banana split', 20, 2)
    print(item2.name)    # Banana Split
    print(item2.total)   # 40
    ```
3. **Apply in Context**: Use in applications like a shopping cart to display capitalized item names and calculate total costs (e.g., for invoices), or in inventory systems to track stock value.
4. **Explore Flexibility**: Test with various inputs, such as multi-word names (`green tea`) or decimal prices, to confirm consistent title-casing and accurate total calculations.

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `Item` class provides a robust and intuitive solution for representing products in Python, with a focus on delivering a capitalized `name` and a dynamic `total` attribute calculated as `price * quantity`. By leveraging `__getattribute__`, it achieves precise control over attribute access, ensuring the specified behavior without altering the stored data unnecessarily.
This implementation corrects any prior errors by explicitly handling the `name` and `total` attributes, making it reliable for scenarios where presentation (capitalized names) and computation (total cost) are critical.
Its design is both practical for real-world use‚Äîsuch as in retail or inventory management‚Äîand educational, showcasing advanced Python techniques like custom attribute access.
While already complete, the class could be extended with features like setters for updating attributes, discount calculations, or string formatting for currency, but it fully meets the task‚Äôs requirements with clarity and efficiency, ready to enhance any project needing item-based data handling.
