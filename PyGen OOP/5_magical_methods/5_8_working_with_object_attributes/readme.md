```
# Item Class Product Descriptor
The `Item` class models a product with attributes for `name`, `price`, and `quantity`, accepting these as arguments during instantiation.
It ensures the `name` attribute is returned with a capital letter (title case) and provides a `total` attribute that computes the product of `price` and `quantity` dynamically.
This implementation corrects an assumed faulty prior version by properly handling attribute access to meet the specified requirements.
This class is designed for inventory or e-commerce scenarios, enabling easy tracking of item details and their total cost.
Itâ€™s suitable for retail applications, educational examples of custom attribute access in Python, or any context where products need to be represented with dynamic calculations, such as shopping carts or stock management systems.
