This lesson has good theory explonation, 8 programing practical tasks and 6 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 5_8_1_Item

```
# Item Class Product Descriptor
The `Item` class models a product with attributes for `name`, `price`, and `quantity`, accepting these as arguments during instantiation.
It ensures the `name` attribute is returned with a capital letter (title case) and provides a `total` attribute that computes the product of `price` and `quantity` dynamically.
This implementation corrects an assumed faulty prior version by properly handling attribute access to meet the specified requirements.
This class is designed for inventory or e-commerce scenarios, enabling easy tracking of item details and their total cost.
It’s suitable for retail applications, educational examples of custom attribute access in Python, or any context where products need to be represented with dynamic calculations, such as shopping carts or stock management systems.
```

2. 5_8_2_Logger

```
# Logger Class Attribute Tracker
The `Logger` class is a utility designed to monitor and log modifications to its instance attributes without requiring initialization arguments.
Whenever an attribute is set or updated, it prints a message indicating the attribute name and its new value.
Similarly, when an attribute is deleted, it logs the deletion event with the attribute’s name.
This implementation corrects any prior incorrect attempts by properly handling attribute operations using Python’s special methods.
This class is tailored for debugging, auditing, or tracking changes to object state in Python applications.
It’s ideal for scenarios where developers need visibility into attribute modifications, such as in configuration management, testing environments, or educational settings to illustrate dynamic attribute handling.
Its logging behavior provides a clear audit trail for attribute interactions, enhancing transparency in object lifecycle management.
```

3. 5_8_3_Ord

```
# Ord Class Unicode Accessor
The `Ord` class serves as an alternative interface to Python’s built-in `ord()` function, designed to return the Unicode code point of a single-character attribute name when accessed.
It requires no arguments during instantiation and dynamically handles attribute requests, providing the Unicode value for valid single-character names or raising an `AttributeError` for invalid ones.
This class is crafted for scenarios where accessing Unicode code points via attribute syntax is preferred over function calls, offering a novel way to interact with character encodings.
It’s ideal for educational purposes to demonstrate Python’s dynamic attribute handling, or in specialized applications like text processing, character mapping, or creative coding projects where attribute-based access to Unicode values enhances code expressiveness.
