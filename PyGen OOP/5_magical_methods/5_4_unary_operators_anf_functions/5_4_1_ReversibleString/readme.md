# ReversibleString Class Text Flipper

## Description 📝

The `ReversibleString` class represents a string, initialized with a given value.
It provides an informal string representation via `__str__` as the original string and supports the unary minus operator (`-`) via `__neg__`, which returns a new instance with the string reversed.

## Purpose 🎯

This class is designed for simple string manipulation, suitable for educational examples of operator overloading, text processing utilities, or applications needing reversible strings.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Initialization**: The `__init__` method sets the `string` attribute from the provided value.
-   ****str**() Method**: Returns the string value as the informal representation.
-   ****neg**() Method**: Implements the unary minus operator, creating a new `ReversibleString` instance with the string reversed using slicing (`[::-1]`).

## Usage 📦

1. Save the class in a Python file, e.g., `reversible_string.py`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run Python and test the class:

```python
from reversible_string import ReversibleString
s = ReversibleString("hello")
print(s)
reversed_s = -s
print(reversed_s)
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `ReversibleString` class offers a straightforward way to create and reverse strings in Python using a unary operator, providing an intuitive interface for string flipping.
Its minimal design is easily extensible with additional operators or string methods for more advanced text handling.
