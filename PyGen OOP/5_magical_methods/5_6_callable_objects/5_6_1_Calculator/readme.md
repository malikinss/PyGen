# Calculator Class Arithmetic Engine

## Description üìù

The `Calculator` class creates callable instances for performing basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on two numbers, requiring no initialization arguments.
It uses a dictionary of operator functions and handles division by zero with a `ValueError`.

## Purpose üéØ

This class is designed for simple arithmetic tasks, suitable for educational examples of callable objects, basic computation utilities, or applications needing flexible operation execution.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Initialization**: No arguments; defines `_operations` dictionary mapping symbols to `operator` module functions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `truediv`).
-   ****call**()**: Makes instances callable, taking `a`, `b`, and `operation`:
    -   Checks for division by zero, raising `ValueError` if `operation == '/'` and `b == 0`.
    -   Executes the specified operation using the mapped function and returns the result.

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the class in a Python file, e.g., `calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run Python and test the class:

```python
from calculator import Calculator
calc = Calculator()
print(calc(5, 3, '+'))  # 8
print(calc(5, 3, '-'))  # 2
print(calc(5, 3, '*'))  # 15
print(calc(6, 2, '/'))  # 3.0
# calc(5, 0, '/')  # Raises ValueError: Division by zero is impossible
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `Calculator` class provides an elegant and efficient way to perform arithmetic in Python, leveraging Python‚Äôs callable object feature and the `operator` module for clarity.
Its design is extensible, allowing easy addition of more operations or error handling for broader computational needs.
