```
# Calculator Class Arithmetic Engine
The `Calculator` class creates callable instances for performing basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on two numbers, requiring no initialization arguments.
It uses a dictionary of operator functions and handles division by zero with a `ValueError`.
This class is designed for simple arithmetic tasks, suitable for educational examples of callable objects, basic computation utilities, or applications needing flexible operation execution.
