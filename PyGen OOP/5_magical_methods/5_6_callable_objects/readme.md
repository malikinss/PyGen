This lesson has good theory explonation, 10 programing practical tasks and 7 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 5_6_1_Calculator

```
# Calculator Class Arithmetic Engine
The `Calculator` class creates callable instances for performing basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on two numbers, requiring no initialization arguments.
It uses a dictionary of operator functions and handles division by zero with a `ValueError`.
This class is designed for simple arithmetic tasks, suitable for educational examples of callable objects, basic computation utilities, or applications needing flexible operation execution.
```

2. 5_6_2_RaiseTo

```
# RaiseTo Class Power Function
The `RaiseTo` class creates callable instances that raise a number to a fixed exponent specified during instantiation.
It takes one argument (`degree`) at creation and one argument (`x`) when called, returning `x` raised to `degree`.
This class is designed for exponentiation tasks, suitable for mathematical utilities, educational examples of callable objects, or applications needing repeated power operations.
```

3. 5_6_3_Dice

```
# Dice Class Random Roller
The `Dice` class models a die with a specified number of sides, set during instantiation.
It’s a callable object that, when invoked with no arguments, returns a random integer from 1 to the number of sides, simulating a dice roll using `random.randint`.
This class is designed for random number generation within a range, ideal for games, simulations, educational examples of callable objects, or applications needing dice-like randomness.
```

4. 5_6_4_QuadraticPolynomial

```
# QuadraticPolynomial Class Function Evaluator
The `QuadraticPolynomial` class represents a quadratic trinomial `ax^2 + bx + c`, initialized with coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.
It’s a callable object that takes a number `x` and returns the polynomial’s value at that point, computed as `ax^2 + bx + c`.
This class is designed for evaluating quadratic expressions, suitable for mathematical modeling, educational examples of callable objects, or applications needing polynomial calculations.
