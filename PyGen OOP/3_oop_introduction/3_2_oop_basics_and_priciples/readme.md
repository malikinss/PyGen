# Lesson 3.2: Basics and Principles of OOP 🔍

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   The basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
-   Classes and Objects.
-   Core principles of OOP.
-   Key concepts like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

This lesson focuses on understanding the foundation of OOP and how it applies to real-world programming problems.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand what classes and objects are in OOP.  
✅ Learn the core principles that drive OOP.  
✅ Know how to apply OOP principles to develop maintainable and reusable software.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson focuses on the following concepts:

### 🔹 Classes and Objects

-   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
-   **Object**: An instance of a class. It contains real values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the methods of the class.

For example, a `Car` class might define attributes like `color`, `model`, and `engine_type`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`. An object of the `Car` class might represent a specific car like a "red Toyota Camry with a V6 engine."

### 🔹 Principles of OOP

OOP relies on four key principles that enable the development of modular, reusable, and flexible code. These are:

1. **Encapsulation**:

    - The practice of keeping fields within a class private and providing access through public methods (getters and setters).
    - This protects the internal state of an object from being changed directly, ensuring the object's integrity.

2. **Abstraction**:

    - Hiding the complexity of the system and exposing only the necessary details.
    - It helps to simplify the user interface by focusing on the essential features of an object and hiding unnecessary details.

3. **Inheritance**:

    - The ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
    - This helps in creating a hierarchy of classes and promotes code reuse.

4. **Polymorphism**:
    - The ability to take on different forms. In OOP, it means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common super class.
    - It allows one interface to be used for different types of objects.

### 🔹 Practical Applications

-   OOP principles are used in designing applications that are scalable and easy to maintain.
-   Popular frameworks such as Flask (Python), Angular (JavaScript), and Spring (Java) all leverage these principles for efficient code management and ease of extension.

## Practical Tasks 🖥️

-   This lesson does not include practical tasks, but there are 9 theoretical questions available on the website. These questions will help reinforce the concepts discussed in the lesson.

## Output 📜

By completing this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the fundamental OOP concepts of classes and objects.  
✅ Learn the core principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.  
✅ Be able to apply OOP principles to real-world programming problems.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson solidifies my understanding of the basic building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming.
Knowing how to create and manage classes and objects, as well as applying OOP principles, will be essential for developing more advanced software applications.
By completing the theoretical questions, I will deepen my understanding and gain practical insight into OOP principles. 💡
