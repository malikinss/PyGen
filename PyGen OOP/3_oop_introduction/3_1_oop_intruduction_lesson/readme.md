# Lesson 3.1: Introduction to OOP 🔍

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will cover the following topics:

-   Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
-   Comparison between procedural programming and OOP.
-   Advantages and disadvantages of OOP.
-   Key principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

This lesson focuses on providing an understanding of the foundational concepts in OOP, including its structure and benefits over procedural programming.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
✅ Learn the differences between Procedural Programming and OOP.  
✅ Be able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of OOP.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson focuses on the following concepts:

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-   OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods).
-   OOP emphasizes reusability and modularity, which can improve the scalability and maintainability of software.

### 🔹 Procedural Programming

-   Procedural programming follows a set of instructions in a linear order. The focus is on writing functions (procedures) that operate on data.
-   While it’s efficient for small programs, procedural programming can become difficult to maintain as the program grows in complexity.

### 🔹 Advantages of OOP

-   **Encapsulation**: Bundles data with methods that operate on that data, keeping both safe from outside interference.
-   **Inheritance**: Enables one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another, facilitating code reuse.
-   **Polymorphism**: Allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface.

### 🔹 Disadvantages of OOP

-   **Complexity**: OOP can introduce unnecessary complexity, especially for small programs.
-   **Performance**: The extra layers of abstraction in OOP may reduce performance compared to procedural programming in certain cases.

### 🔹 Practical Applications

-   OOP principles are widely used in creating large-scale applications, especially in frameworks like Django (Python) or Spring (Java), where modularity and reusability are essential.
-   OOP can be applied in designing UI applications, simulation models, and game development.

## Practical Tasks 🖥️

-   This lesson does not have practical tasks, but there are 12 theoretical questions presented on the website. They will help to deepen the understanding of the topics covered.

## Output 📜

By completing this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming.  
✅ Be able to compare OOP with Procedural Programming.  
✅ Identify the pros and cons of using OOP in software development.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson enhances my skills by introducing the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, which are fundamental for developing maintainable and scalable software.  
By completing the tasks and questions, I will be better equipped to apply OOP in various programming projects and understand its advantages and limitations. 💡
