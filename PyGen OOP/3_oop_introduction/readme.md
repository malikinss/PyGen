# Chapter 3: Introduction to OOP 📘

## Description 📝

Chapter 3 dives into the heart of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. In this chapter, I will introduce the core concepts of OOP, compare it with procedural programming, and explore the foundational principles that shape the way I design and build software.
By understanding these principles, I will gain the necessary skills to start writing maintainable and reusable code.

## Purpose 🎯

In this chapter, I will:

-   Learn the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
-   Understand how **OOP** differs from **procedural programming**.
-   Explore key principles of OOP, including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
-   Understand how to apply these principles to solve real-world programming problems.

## Lessons Overview 📚

### Lesson 3.1: Introduction to OOP 🔍

In this lesson, I will cover:

-   An **introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
-   A comparison between **procedural programming** and **OOP**.
-   The **advantages and disadvantages** of using OOP.
-   The key **principles of OOP**: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
-   ✅ Learn the differences between **Procedural Programming** and OOP.
-   ✅ Be able to identify the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of OOP.

### Lesson 3.2: Basics and Principles of OOP 🔍

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   The basic **concepts** of OOP.
-   The role of **Classes** and **Objects**.
-   The **core principles** of OOP.
-   The key concepts like **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand what **Classes** and **Objects** are in OOP.
-   ✅ Learn the **core principles** that drive OOP.
-   ✅ Know how to apply **OOP principles** to develop **maintainable** and **reusable** software.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of Chapter 3, I will have a solid understanding of the foundational OOP concepts that form the backbone of modern software development.
These principles are essential for writing modular and extensible code, which I will build on in subsequent chapters.
