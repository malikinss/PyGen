# BasicPlan, SilverPlan, and GoldPlan Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code implements three classes: `BasicPlan`, `SilverPlan`, and `GoldPlan`, representing subscription tiers for an online service.
`BasicPlan` defines a basic subscription with specific attributes. `SilverPlan` and `GoldPlan`, subclasses of `BasicPlan`, describe mid-level and high-level subscriptions, respectively, overriding certain attributes.
All classes require no arguments for instantiation and define seven attributes as specified.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to model subscription plans for online services like streaming platforms, with tiered features and pricing.
The hierarchy is suitable for managing user subscriptions, feature access control, or billing systems, as well as educational examples of inheritance and attribute overriding in Python.
