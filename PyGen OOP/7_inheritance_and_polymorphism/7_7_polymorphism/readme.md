# USADate and ItalianDate Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `USADate` and `ItalianDate` classes to represent dates in American (MM-DD-YYYY) and Italian (DD/MM/YYYY) formats, respectively.
Both classes inherit from an abstract base class `AnyDate`, which centralizes shared logic for date storage and ISO formatting.
Each class accepts `year`, `month`, and `day` during instantiation and provides two methods: `format()` for the specific format and `iso_format()` for the ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring date representation in localized formats, such as internationalization, user interfaces, or data processing.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples of inheritance, abstract base classes, and date handling in Python.
