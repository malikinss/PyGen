# Middle and Inheritance Scheme Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `Middle` abstract base class and establishes a correct inheritance scheme for the `Average`, `Median`, and `Harmonic` classes.
The `Middle` class serves as a common interface for calculating average ratings (arithmetic mean, median, or harmonic mean) from user and expert votes on a 100-point scale.
It avoids code duplication by centralizing shared functionality, such as vote filtering, while requiring subclasses to implement the specific average calculation via the abstract `get_average` method.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to unify the interface and shared logic of the `Average`, `Median`, and `Harmonic` classes, which process user and expert ratings for media content.
This hierarchy promotes code reuse, maintainability, and extensibility, making it suitable for applications like rating systems or statistical analysis, as well as educational examples of abstract base classes and inheritance in Python.
