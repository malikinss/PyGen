TODO:
    Implement a BitArray class that describes a bit list, that is, a list
    whose elements are only zeros and ones.

    When instantiating the class, it must accept one argument:
        iterable â€” an iterable defining the initial set of elements of the bit
                   list.
                   If not passed, the initial set is considered empty

    An instance of the BitArray class must have the following informal string
    representation:
        [
            <first element of the bit list>,
            <second element of the bit list>, ...
        ]

    Passing an instance of the BitArray class to the len() function must
    return the number of elements in it.

    Passing an instance of the BitArray class to the reversed() function must
    return an iterator whose elements are the elements of the passed instance
    of the BitArray class, arranged in reverse order.

    An instance of the BitArray class must be an iterable object, that is,
    it must allow its elements to be iterated over, for example, using
    a for loop.

    In addition, an instance of the BitArray class must support the membership
    operation using the in operator.

    Also, an instance of the BitArray class must allow the values of its
    elements to be retrieved using indices, both positive and negative.

    In addition, an instance of the BitArray class must support the unary
    operator ~, which performs the logical negation operation on each bit of
    the bit list, thereby converting 0 to 1, and 1 to 0.

    The result of the operator
    must be a new instance of the BitArray class.

    Finally, instances of the BitArray class must support logical operations
    between themselves using the & and | operators:
        the & operator must perform the logical AND operation on each pair
        of bits of two bit lists of equal length.

        The result of the operator must be a new instance of the BitArray class

        the | operator must perform the logical OR operation on each pair
        of bits of two bit lists of equal length.

        The result of the operator must be a new instance of the BitArray class

NOTE:
    Before deciding, think about which abstract class from the collections.abc
    module would be convenient as a parent.

    An instance of the BitArray class must not depend on the iterable object
    on which it was created.

    In other words, if the original iterable object changes, the instance of
    the BitArray class must not change.

    If the object with which a logical operation is performed is invalid,
    the method implementing this operation must return the NotImplemented
    constant.

    There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of the BitArray
    class, it can be arbitrary.
