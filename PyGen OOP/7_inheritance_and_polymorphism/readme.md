# Lesson 7.1: Inheritance (Part 1) 🧬

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   Introduction to inheritance in Python
-   Defining and overriding attributes and methods
-   Implicit inheritance and the `object` class
-   Multilevel inheritance

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 6 programming practical tasks, and 21 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the fundamentals of inheritance in Python
✅ Define and override methods and attributes in subclasses
✅ Apply implicit and multilevel inheritance effectively
✅ Create class hierarchies for practical use cases
```

2. 7_2_inheritance_part_2

```
# Lesson 7.2: Inheritance (Part 2) 🧬

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   Overriding methods in subclasses
-   Extending methods to enhance inherited behavior
-   The `super()` function for accessing parent class methods
-   Using descendant methods in a base class

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 6 programming practical tasks, and 14 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Override and extend methods to customize subclass behavior
✅ Use `super()` to leverage parent class functionality
✅ Design base classes that utilize descendant methods
✅ Apply advanced inheritance techniques to practical scenarios
```

3. 7_3_inheritance_part_3

```
# Lesson 7.3: Inheritance (Part 3) 🧬

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   The process of creating class instances
-   Inheritance from immutable built-in data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`)

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 8 programming practical tasks, and 13 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to create instances of classes inheriting from immutable types
✅ Extend built-in immutable types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`) with custom behavior
✅ Apply inheritance to enhance functionality of immutable data types
✅ Implement practical subclasses for specialized string, integer, and tuple operations
