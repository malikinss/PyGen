# Chapter 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism 🧬

## Description 📝

This chapter is dedicated to mastering **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in Python, enabling me to create flexible, reusable, and well-structured class hierarchies.  
It consists of **8 comprehensive lessons** with in-depth theoretical explanations, **49 hands-on programming tasks**, and **113 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.

## Purpose 🎯

In this chapter, I will:

-   Learn how to use **inheritance** to build class hierarchies and extend functionality.

-   ✅ Extend built-in immutable types with custom behavior.
-   ✅ Apply inheritance to enhance functionality of immutable data types.
-   ✅ Implement practical subclasses for specialized string, integer, and tuple operations.

### Lesson 7.4: Inheritance (Part 4) 🧬

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   Inheritance from the **`dict`** type.
-   Inheritance from the **`list`** type.
-   Using **`UserDict`** and **`UserList`** from the **`collections`** module.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Extend **`dict`** and **`list`** types with custom functionality.
-   ✅ Use **`UserDict`** and **`UserList`** for safer, flexible subclassing.
-   ✅ Implement specialized dictionaries and lists for practical use cases.
-   ✅ Apply inheritance to enhance collection types.

### Lesson 7.5: Abstract Classes and Module abc 📚

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   Abstract classes in Python.
-   The **`abc`** module for defining abstract base classes.
-   The **`collections.abc`** module for collection-based abstract classes.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand and create abstract classes using the **`abc`** module.
-   ✅ Use **`collections.abc`** to implement collection-like interfaces.
-   ✅ Enforce interface contracts with abstract methods.
-   ✅ Apply abstract classes to practical scenarios like DNA sequences and chess pieces.

### Lesson 7.6: Multiple Inheritance 🔗

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   Multiple inheritance in Python.
-   The diamond inheritance problem.
-   Method Resolution Order (MRO).

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand and implement multiple inheritance.
-   ✅ Recognize and resolve the diamond inheritance problem.
-   ✅ Use Method Resolution Order (MRO) to predict attribute lookup.
-   ✅ Apply multiple inheritance to practical class hierarchies.

### Lesson 7.7: Polymorphism 🌟

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   The concept of polymorphism in Python.
-   Polymorphism of operators.
-   Polymorphism of functions.
-   Polymorphism in class methods.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand polymorphism and its applications in Python.
-   ✅ Implement polymorphic behavior in operators, functions, and methods.
-   ✅ Design classes that share interfaces for flexible behavior.
-   ✅ Apply polymorphism to practical scenarios like date formatting and statistics.

### Lesson 7.8: Composition 🛠️

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   The concept of composition in class design.
-   Composition versus inheritance.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand composition and its role in object-oriented design.
-   ✅ Compare composition with inheritance for class relationships.
-   ✅ Implement classes using composition for practical scenarios.
-   ✅ Design flexible, modular systems with composed objects.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing Chapter 7, I will have mastered **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **composition** in Python, enabling me to design robust, flexible, and reusable class hierarchies.
These skills will enhance my ability to write modular, maintainable, and efficient code, preparing me for advanced object-oriented programming and real-world Python applications.
