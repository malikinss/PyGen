# ModularTuple Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `ModularTuple` class, a subclass of Python's built-in `tuple` class.
It creates a tuple where each element from the input iterable is divided by a specified `size` (integer, default 100), retaining only the remainder (using the modulo operator `%`).
The class accepts two arguments during instantiation: `iterable` (an iterable defining the initial elements, defaulting to an empty tuple) and `size` (the divisor).
The resulting tuple is independent of the original iterable, ensuring immutability and isolation from external changes.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for scenarios requiring modular arithmetic on sequences, such as cryptographic algorithms, cyclic data structures, or constrained numerical processing.
It’s also suitable for educational examples of tuple subclassing and custom object creation in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Class Definition**:
    -   `ModularTuple` inherits from `tuple`, inheriting all tuple behaviors.
-   **Object Creation (`__new__`)**:
    -   Overrides `__new__` to control instance creation (since `tuple` is immutable).
    -   Accepts `iterable` (any iterable, default `()`) and `size` (integer, default `100`).
    -   Converts `iterable` to a tuple of remainders: `x % size` for each element `x`.
    -   Creates a new `tuple` instance with these remainders using `super().__new__(cls, new_iterable)`.
    -   Returns the `ModularTuple` instance.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   The instance is a tuple containing the modulo `size` remainders of the input elements.
    -   It is immutable and independent of the original iterable (changes to the input iterable do not affect the instance).
    -   All standard `tuple` operations (e.g., indexing, slicing) work as expected.
    -   Elements are computed as `x % size`, ensuring they are integers in the range `[0, size-1]`.

## Verification ✅

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Initialization**:
    -   Accepts `iterable` and `size` (default `100`): `ModularTuple([1, 2, 3], 5)`, `ModularTuple(range(3))`, `ModularTuple()`.
    -   E.g., `ModularTuple([105, 3, 202], 100)` → `(5, 3, 2)`.
-   **Modular Elements**:
    -   Each element is `x % size`: `ModularTuple([7, 8, 9], 7)` → `(0, 1, 2)`.
    -   Empty iterable: `ModularTuple()` → `()`.
    -   Default size: `ModularTuple([101, 50])` → `(1, 50)` (mod 100).
-   **Independence**:
    -   Changes to the input iterable do not affect the tuple.
    -   E.g., `lst = [1, 2]; t = ModularTuple(lst, 2); lst[0] = 3; print(t)` → `(1, 0)`.
-   **Tuple Behavior**:
    -   Inherits `tuple` methods: `t[0]`, `len(t)`, etc.
    -   E.g., `t = ModularTuple([5, 6], 5); t[1]` → `1`.
-   **Inheritance**:
    -   `issubclass(ModularTuple, tuple)` → `True`.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstring with type hints.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Correctness**: `x % size` correctly computes remainders for all elements. Converting `iterable` to a tuple in `__new__` ensures immutability and independence from the input. No validation needed per requirements.
-   **Performance**: Modulo operation and tuple creation are O(n) (n is the length of the iterable), efficient for typical use.
-   **Design**: `__new__` is appropriate for immutable `tuple` subclassing. Precomputing remainders in a generator expression is concise and leverages Python’s tuple construction. Type hints and `collections.abc.Iterable` enhance clarity.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
# Create instances
t1 = ModularTuple([105, 203, 3], 100)
t2 = ModularTuple([7, 8, 9], 7)
t3 = ModularTuple()
lst = [1, 2]
t4 = ModularTuple(lst, 2)

# Test values
print(t1)  # (5, 3, 3)
print(t2)  # (0, 1, 2)
print(t3)  # ()

# Test independence
lst[0] = 3
print(t4)  # (1, 0) (unchanged)

# Test tuple operations
print(t1[0])  # 5
print(len(t2))  # 3
print(isinstance(t1, tuple))  # True
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `ModularTuple` implementation is precise, creating a tuple with modular remainders while ensuring independence from the input iterable and retaining full `tuple` functionality.
It’s ideal for modular arithmetic applications or tuple subclassing education, fully compliant with the task’s requirements.
