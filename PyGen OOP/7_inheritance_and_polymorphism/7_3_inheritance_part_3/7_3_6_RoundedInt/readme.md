# RoundedInt Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `RoundedInt` class, a subclass of Python's built-in `int` class.
It automatically rounds its numeric value to the nearest even or odd integer during instantiation, based on a boolean `even` parameter.
The class accepts two arguments: `num` (the numeric value) and `even` (True for even rounding, False for odd rounding, defaulting to True).
The resulting instance is an integer with the rounded value, retaining all `int` functionality.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for scenarios requiring integers to be constrained to specific parity, such as numerical simulations, data normalization, or parity-based algorithms.
It’s also suitable for educational examples of `int` subclassing and custom object creation in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Class Definition**:
    -   `RoundedInt` inherits from `int`, ensuring the instance behaves as an integer.
-   **Object Creation (`__new__`)**:
    -   Overrides `__new__` to control instance creation (since `int` is immutable).
    -   Accepts `num` (any type convertible to `int`) and `even` (boolean, default `True`).
    -   Converts `num` to an integer using `int(num)`.
    -   Checks if `num`’s parity matches the desired parity (`0` for even, `1` for odd, using `num % 2`).
    -   If mismatched, increments `num` by 1 to reach the nearest number of the desired parity.
    -   Creates a new `int` instance with the rounded value using `super().__new__(cls, num)`.
    -   Returns the `RoundedInt` instance.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   The instance’s value is the rounded integer (e.g., `RoundedInt(3, True)` → `4`, `RoundedInt(3, False)` → `3`).
    -   All standard `int` operations (e.g., addition, comparison) work as expected.
    -   Rounding occurs only during instantiation.

## Verification ✅

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Initialization**:
    -   Accepts two arguments: `num` and `even` (default `True`).
    -   E.g., `RoundedInt(3, True)`, `RoundedInt(4, False)`, `RoundedInt("5")`.
-   **Rounding Logic**:
    -   Even rounding (`even=True`):
        -   Odd `n` → `n + 1`: `RoundedInt(3, True)` → `4`.
        -   Even `n` → `n`: `RoundedInt(4, True)` → `4`.
    -   Odd rounding (`even=False`):
        -   Even `n` → `n + 1`: `RoundedInt(4, False)` → `5`.
        -   Odd `n` → `n`: `RoundedInt(3, False)` → `3`.
    -   E.g., `RoundedInt(7, True)` → `8`, `RoundedInt(7, False)` → `7`.
-   **Integer Behavior**:
    -   Inherits all `int` methods: `r + 1`, `r % 2`, etc.
    -   E.g., `r = RoundedInt(3, True); r + 2` → `6`.
-   **Inheritance**:
    -   `issubclass(RoundedInt, int)` → `True`.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstring with type hints.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Correctness**: `num % 2 != (0 if even else 1)` accurately checks parity mismatch; incrementing by 1 ensures the nearest number of desired parity. No validation needed per requirements.
-   **Performance**: Integer conversion and arithmetic are O(1), highly efficient.
-   **Design**: `__new__` is ideal for immutable `int` subclassing. Conditional logic is concise and clear. The implementation is minimal, leveraging `int` inheritance.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
# Create instances
r1 = RoundedInt(3, True)   # Rounds to even: 4
r2 = RoundedInt(3, False)  # Rounds to odd: 3
r3 = RoundedInt(4, True)   # Rounds to even: 4
r4 = RoundedInt(4, False)  # Rounds to odd: 5

# Test values
print(r1)  # 4
print(r2)  # 3
print(r3)  # 4
print(r4)  # 5

# Test integer operations
print(r1 + 2)  # 6
print(r4 % 2)  # 1 (odd)
print(isinstance(r1, int))  # True
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `RoundedInt` implementation is precise, automatically rounding integers to the nearest even or odd number during instantiation while retaining full `int` functionality.
It’s ideal for parity-constrained numerical tasks or `int` subclassing education, fully compliant with the task’s requirements.
