# Vehicle Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code defines a hierarchy of empty classes representing vehicles, structured according to the given diagram.
The hierarchy uses inheritance to model relationships between a base `Vehicle` class and its subclasses, categorized by their operating environment (land, water, air) and further specialized into specific vehicle types.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to establish a foundational class structure for modeling vehicles in applications such as transportation systems, simulations, or inventory management.
The empty classes provide a framework that can be extended with attributes and methods, suitable for object-oriented design or educational examples of inheritance in Python.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Base Class**:
    -   `Vehicle`: The root class for all vehicles, serving as the parent for all other classes.
-   **First-Level Subclasses**:
    -   `LandVehicle`: Inherits from `Vehicle`, parent for land-based vehicles.
    -   `WaterVehicle`: Inherits from `Vehicle`, for water-based vehicles.
    -   `AirVehicle`: Inherits from `Vehicle`, parent for air-based vehicles.
-   **Second-Level Subclasses**:
    -   Under `LandVehicle`:
    -   `Car`: Represents four-wheeled motor vehicles.
    -   `Motorcycle`: Represents two-wheeled motor vehicles.
    -   `Bicycle`: Represents human-powered, pedal-driven vehicles.
    -   Under `AirVehicle`:
    -   `Propeller`: Represents propeller-driven aircraft.
    -   `Jet`: Represents jet-powered aircraft.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   All classes are empty (`pass`), providing a structural hierarchy without implementation.
    -   Inheritance ensures each subclass is a type of its parent (e.g., `Car` is a `LandVehicle`, which is a `Vehicle`).

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Hierarchy Structure**:
    -   Matches the diagram exactly:
    ```
    Vehicle
    |-- LandVehicle
    |   |-- Car
    |   |-- Motorcycle
    |   |-- Bicycle
    |-- WaterVehicle
    |-- AirVehicle
        |-- Propeller
        |-- Jet
    ```
-   **Inheritance**:
    -   `LandVehicle`, `WaterVehicle`, `AirVehicle` inherit from `Vehicle`.
    -   `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bicycle` inherit from `LandVehicle`.
    -   `Propeller`, `Jet` inherit from `AirVehicle`.
    -   Verified with `issubclass`:
    -   `issubclass(Car, LandVehicle)` ‚Üí `True`
    -   `issubclass(Car, Vehicle)` ‚Üí `True`
    -   `issubclass(Propeller, AirVehicle)` ‚Üí `True`
-   **Empty Classes**: All classes use `pass`, containing no attributes or methods.
-   **Documentation**: Each class includes a docstring describing its role.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**: The hierarchy precisely follows the diagram, with correct inheritance chains.
-   **Extensibility**: Empty classes allow easy addition of attributes, methods, or further subclasses.
-   **Design**: Clear docstrings enhance readability; single inheritance keeps the structure simple.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Verify hierarchy
print(issubclass(Car, LandVehicle))  # True
print(issubclass(Car, Vehicle))  # True
print(issubclass(Jet, AirVehicle))  # True
print(issubclass(WaterVehicle, Vehicle))  # True

# Create instances
car = Car()
jet = Jet()
print(isinstance(car, Vehicle))  # True
print(isinstance(jet, AirVehicle))  # True
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `Vehicle` class hierarchy is accurately implemented, mirroring the provided diagram with proper inheritance and clear documentation.
It provides a solid foundation for vehicle-related applications or inheritance education, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
