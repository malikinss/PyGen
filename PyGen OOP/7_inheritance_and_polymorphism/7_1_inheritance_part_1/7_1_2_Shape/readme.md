# Geometric Shape Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code defines a hierarchy of empty classes representing geometric shapes, structured according to the given diagram.
The hierarchy uses inheritance to model relationships between a base `Shape` class and its subclasses, categorized by shape type (circle, polygon) and further specialized into specific shapes like quadrilaterals, triangles, and their variants.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to establish a foundational class structure for modeling geometric shapes in applications such as graphics, CAD systems, or mathematical simulations.
The empty classes provide a framework that can be extended with attributes (e.g., dimensions) and methods (e.g., area calculation), suitable for object-oriented design or educational examples of inheritance in Python.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Base Class**:
    -   `Shape`: The root class for all geometric shapes, serving as the parent for all other classes.
-   **First-Level Subclasses**:
    -   `Circle`: Inherits from `Shape`, representing round shapes.
    -   `Polygon`: Inherits from `Shape`, parent for polygonal shapes.
-   **Second-Level Subclasses**:
    -   Under `Polygon`:
    -   `Quadrilateral`: Parent for four-sided polygons.
    -   `Triangle`: Parent for three-sided polygons.
-   **Third-Level Subclasses**:
    -   Under `Quadrilateral`:
    -   `Parallelogram`: Parent for four-sided polygons with opposite sides equal and parallel.
    -   Under `Triangle`:
    -   `IsoscelesTriangle`: Represents triangles with at least two equal sides.
    -   `EquilateralTriangle`: Represents triangles with all sides and angles equal.
-   **Fourth-Level Subclasses**:
    -   Under `Parallelogram`:
    -   `Rectangle`: Represents parallelograms with right angles.
-   **Fifth-Level Subclasses**:
    -   Under `Rectangle`:
    -   `Square`: Represents rectangles with all sides equal.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   All classes are empty (`pass`), providing a structural hierarchy without implementation.
    -   Inheritance ensures each subclass is a type of its parent (e.g., `Square` is a `Rectangle`, which is a `Parallelogram`, etc.).

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Hierarchy Structure**:
    -   Matches the diagram exactly:
    ```
    Shape
    |-- Circle
    |-- Polygon
        |-- Quadrilateral
        |   |-- Parallelogram
        |       |-- Rectangle
        |           |-- Square
        |-- Triangle
            |-- IsoscelesTriangle
            |-- EquilateralTriangle
    ```
-   **Inheritance**:
    -   `Circle`, `Polygon` inherit from `Shape`.
    -   `Quadrilateral`, `Triangle` inherit from `Polygon`.
    -   `Parallelogram` inherits from `Quadrilateral`.
    -   `Rectangle` inherits from `Parallelogram`.
    -   `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`.
    -   `IsoscelesTriangle`, `EquilateralTriangle` inherit from `Triangle`.
    -   Verified with `issubclass`:
    -   `issubclass(Square, Rectangle)` ‚Üí `True`
    -   `issubclass(Square, Shape)` ‚Üí `True`
    -   `issubclass(EquilateralTriangle, Triangle)` ‚Üí `True`
-   **Empty Classes**: All classes use `pass`, containing no attributes or methods.
-   **Documentation**: Each class includes a docstring describing its role.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**: The hierarchy precisely follows the diagram, with accurate inheritance chains.
-   **Extensibility**: Empty classes allow easy addition of attributes (e.g., `radius` for `Circle`, `sides` for `Polygon`) or methods (e.g., `area`, `perimeter`).
-   **Design**: Clear docstrings enhance readability; deep inheritance for `Square` reflects real-world relationships accurately.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Verify hierarchy
print(issubclass(Square, Rectangle))  # True
print(issubclass(Square, Shape))  # True
print(issubclass(EquilateralTriangle, Triangle))  # True
print(issubclass(Circle, Shape))  # True

# Create instances
square = Square()
circle = Circle()
print(isinstance(square, Shape))  # True
print(isinstance(circle, Shape))  # True
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The geometric shape class hierarchy is accurately implemented, mirroring the provided diagram with proper inheritance and clear documentation.
It provides a solid foundation for shape-related applications or inheritance education, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
