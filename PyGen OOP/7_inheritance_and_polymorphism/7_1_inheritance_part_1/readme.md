1. 7_1_1_Vehicle

```
# Vehicle Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code defines a hierarchy of empty classes representing vehicles, structured according to the given diagram.
The hierarchy uses inheritance to model relationships between a base `Vehicle` class and its subclasses, categorized by their operating environment (land, water, air) and further specialized into specific vehicle types.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to establish a foundational class structure for modeling vehicles in applications such as transportation systems, simulations, or inventory management.
The empty classes provide a framework that can be extended with attributes and methods, suitable for object-oriented design or educational examples of inheritance in Python.
```

2. 7_1_2_Shape

```
# Geometric Shape Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code defines a hierarchy of empty classes representing geometric shapes, structured according to the given diagram.
The hierarchy uses inheritance to model relationships between a base `Shape` class and its subclasses, categorized by shape type (circle, polygon) and further specialized into specific shapes like quadrilaterals, triangles, and their variants.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to establish a foundational class structure for modeling geometric shapes in applications such as graphics, CAD systems, or mathematical simulations.
The empty classes provide a framework that can be extended with attributes (e.g., dimensions) and methods (e.g., area calculation), suitable for object-oriented design or educational examples of inheritance in Python.
