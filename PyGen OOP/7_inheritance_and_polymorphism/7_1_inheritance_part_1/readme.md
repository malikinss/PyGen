# Vehicle Class Hierarchy

## Description üìù

The provided code defines a hierarchy of empty classes representing vehicles, structured according to the given diagram.
The hierarchy uses inheritance to model relationships between a base `Vehicle` class and its subclasses, categorized by their operating environment (land, water, air) and further specialized into specific vehicle types.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended to establish a foundational class structure for modeling vehicles in applications such as transportation systems, simulations, or inventory management.
The empty classes provide a framework that can be extended with attributes and methods, suitable for object-oriented design or educational examples of inheritance in Python.
