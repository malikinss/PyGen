# Point and Circle Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `Point` and `Circle` classes to represent a point and a circle in a 2D plane, respectively.
The `Point` class stores x and y coordinates, while the `Circle` class stores a radius and a center (a `Point` instance).
Both classes provide informal string representations as specified: `(x, y)` for `Point` and `(x, y), r = radius` for `Circle`.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for geometric applications, such as graphics, simulations, or computational geometry.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples of object-oriented programming, class design, and string representation in Python.
