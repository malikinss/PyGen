This lesson has good theory explonation, has 5 programing practical tasks and 7 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 7_8_1_Point

```
# Point and Circle Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `Point` and `Circle` classes to represent a point and a circle in a 2D plane, respectively.
The `Point` class stores x and y coordinates, while the `Circle` class stores a radius and a center (a `Point` instance).
Both classes provide informal string representations as specified: `(x, y)` for `Point` and `(x, y), r = radius` for `Circle`.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for geometric applications, such as graphics, simulations, or computational geometry.
It’s also suitable for educational examples of object-oriented programming, class design, and string representation in Python.

2. 7_8_2_ShoppingCart

```
# Item and ShoppingCart Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `Item` and `ShoppingCart` classes to represent a product and a shopping cart, respectively.
The `Item` class stores a product’s name and price, with a string representation of `<name>, <price>$`.
The `ShoppingCart` class manages a list of `Item` instances, supporting adding items, calculating the total cost, removing items by name, and providing a string representation of all items, one per line.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for e-commerce applications, inventory management, or simulations involving shopping carts.
It’s also suitable for educational examples of object-oriented programming, string representation, and list manipulation in Python.
