1. 7_6_1_class_hierarchy

```
# Class Hierarchy Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements a class hierarchy based on the given diagram, using empty classes in Python.
The hierarchy is structured as follows:

-   `A` is the base class.
-   `C`, `B`, and `D` directly inherit from `A`.
-   `E` inherits from both `B` and `D` (multiple inheritance).

## Purpose 🎯

Intended to define a class hierarchy for use in scenarios requiring inheritance structures, such as object-oriented design, modeling relationships, or educational examples of single and multiple inheritance in Python.

2. 7_6_2_class_hierarchy

```
# Class Hierarchy Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements a class hierarchy based on the given diagram, using empty classes in Python.
The hierarchy is structured as follows:

-   `H` is the base class.
-   `D`, `E`, `F`, and `G` directly inherit from `H`.
-   `B` inherits from `D` and `E` (multiple inheritance).
-   `C` inherits from `F` and `G` (multiple inheritance).
-   `A` inherits from `B` and `C` (multiple inheritance).

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for defining a class hierarchy for use in scenarios requiring complex inheritance structures, such as object-oriented design, modeling relationships, or educational examples of multiple inheritance in Python.
