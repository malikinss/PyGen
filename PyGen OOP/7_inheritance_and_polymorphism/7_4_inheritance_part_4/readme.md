# DefaultList Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `DefaultList` class, a subclass of `collections.UserList`.
It represents a list that returns a specified default value when attempting to access an element at a non-existent index.
The class is initialized with two arguments: `iterable` (defining the initial elements, defaulting to an empty tuple) and `default` (the value returned for out-of-bounds indices, defaulting to `None`).
The list is independent of the input iterable, ensuring that changes to the original iterable do not affect the `DefaultList` instance.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios where safe index access is needed, such as data processing, user input handling, or dynamic list manipulation, avoiding `IndexError` exceptions.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples of list subclassing and custom indexing behavior in Python.
