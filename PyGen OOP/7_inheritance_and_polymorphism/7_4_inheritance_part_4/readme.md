This lesson has good theory explonation, has 8 programing practical tasks and 14 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 7_4_1_DefaultList

```
# DefaultList Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `DefaultList` class, a subclass of `collections.UserList`.
It represents a list that returns a specified default value when attempting to access an element at a non-existent index.
The class is initialized with two arguments: `iterable` (defining the initial elements, defaulting to an empty tuple) and `default` (the value returned for out-of-bounds indices, defaulting to `None`).
The list is independent of the input iterable, ensuring that changes to the original iterable do not affect the `DefaultList` instance.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios where safe index access is needed, such as data processing, user input handling, or dynamic list manipulation, avoiding `IndexError` exceptions.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples of list subclassing and custom indexing behavior in Python.
```

2. 7_4_2_EasyDict

```
# EasyDict Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `EasyDict` class, a subclass of Python's built-in `dict` class. It allows dictionary values to be accessed and modified both via standard key-based access (`d[key]`) and attribute-style access (`d.key`).
The initialization process matches that of `dict`, accepting the same arguments.
The class supports getting, setting, and deleting values using attribute notation, mirroring dictionary key operations.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios where dictionary access needs to be more intuitive or readable, such as configuration objects, data models, or API response handling.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples of dictionary subclassing and attribute access customization in Python.
