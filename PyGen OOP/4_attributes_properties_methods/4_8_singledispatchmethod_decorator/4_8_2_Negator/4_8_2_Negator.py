TODO:
    Implement the Negator class.

    The class must not take any arguments when instantiated.

    The Negator class must have one static method:
        - neg() â€” a method that takes an object as an argument and returns
                  its opposite.

    If the method is passed an integer or a real number, it must return this
    number taken with the opposite sign.

    If the method is passed a boolean value as an argument, it must return
    the boolean value that is the opposite of the passed one.

    If the passed object belongs to some other type, a TypeError exception
    must be raised with the text:
        Argument of the passed type is not supported

NOTE:
    Additional data validation is not required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of
    the Negator class, it can be arbitrary.
