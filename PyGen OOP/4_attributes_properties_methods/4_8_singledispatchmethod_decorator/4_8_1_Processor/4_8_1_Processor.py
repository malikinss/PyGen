TODO:
    You have access to the Processor class.

    The class does not take any arguments when instantiated.

    The Processor class has one static method:
        - process() â€” a method that takes an arbitrary object as an argument,
                      converts it depending on its type, and returns the
                      result.
                      If the type of the passed object is not supported by
                      the method, a TypeError exception is raised with
                      the text:
                        The argument of the passed type is not supported

    Rewrite the process() method of the Processor class using
    the @singledispatchmethod decorator to perform the same task.

NOTE:
    Examples of converting objects of all supported types are shown in
    the process() method of the Processor class.

    There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of the Processor
    class, it can be arbitrary.
