# Lesson 4.3: Class Instance Methods (Part 2) 🔍

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on designing and implementing classes with instance methods.  
It provides a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming by exploring real-world examples of class structures.

Topics covered:

-   Class design and structuring.
-   Implementing instance methods.
-   Handling attributes and encapsulation.
-   Various use cases for classes in simulations and utilities.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn how to design and implement classes effectively.  
✅ Understand the role of instance methods in object-oriented programming.  
✅ Gain hands-on experience with class-based problem-solving.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson includes **15 practical tasks** that focus on real-world class design examples.  
Each task presents a different class with specific behaviors and attributes.

### 🔹 Class Design Examples

1. **Gun** – A simple firearm simulation with a `shoot()` method.
2. **User** – Represents an internet user with a name and friend count.
3. **House** – Models a house with color and room count modifications.
4. **Circle** – A circle class that calculates its area and diameter.
5. **Bee** – Simulates a bee's movement in a 2D plane.
6. **Gun (Alternating Sounds)** – A gun that alternates between "pif" and "paf" when fired.
7. **Gun (Shot Tracking)** – A gun that tracks the number of shots fired and can reset.
8. **Scales** – Simulates a two-pan balance scale.
9. **Vector** – Represents a 2D vector with magnitude calculation.
10. **Numbers** – Manages a collection of integers, separating even and odd numbers.
11. **TextHandler** – Extracts and processes words from text.
12. **Todo** – A to-do list with priority-based task management.
13. **Postman** – Manages a postman’s delivery schedule by tracking addresses.
14. **Wordplay** – Filters and manages a collection of words.
15. **Knight** – Models a chess knight’s movements and valid move calculations.

Each class is designed to reinforce key OOP principles such as:

-   **Encapsulation** (managing attributes privately and using methods for access).
-   **Abstraction** (hiding unnecessary details while exposing key functionalities).
-   **State Management** (tracking changes to attributes over time).

## Practical Tasks 🖥️

This lesson includes **15 programming exercises**, available on the Stepik platform:

Each exercise focuses on implementing and testing instance methods in a specific class.

## Output 📜

By completing this lesson, I will:
✅ Improve my ability to design and implement class-based programs.  
✅ Develop a deeper understanding of instance methods and state management.  
✅ Apply OOP principles to solve real-world problems using Python.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson strengthens my OOP skills by providing hands-on experience with **class design and instance methods**.  
By working through these **15 exercises**, I will gain confidence in structuring classes and implementing functionality effectively.  
These skills will be crucial for building scalable and maintainable software systems in the future. 💡
