# Chapter 4: Attributes, Properties, and Methods 🧠

## Description 📝

This chapter is dedicated to deepening **my understanding of classes and objects** in Python by learning how to define, access, and control **attributes**, as well as how to use **methods** and **decorators** to structure my code more efficiently.  
It consists of **8 detailed lessons** with solid theoretical explanations, **38 hands-on coding tasks**, and **98 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.

## Purpose 🎯

In this chapter, I will:

-   Learn how to work with **object and class attributes**.
-   Understand the difference between **instance methods**, **class methods**, and **static methods**.
-   Use **access modifiers**, **accessors**, and **property decorators** to enforce data encapsulation and maintain clean code.
-   Practice building real-world classes and designing flexible, reusable objects.

## Course Modules 📚

### Lesson 4.1: Attributes of Objects and Classes 🏛️

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
-   Understanding the `dir()` function.
-   Differentiating between **object** attributes and **class** attributes.
-   Using the `__dict__` attribute.
-   Working with `getattr()`, `setattr()`, `hasattr()`, and `delattr()` functions.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand the difference between **object** and **class** attributes.
-   ✅ Learn how to **inspect** and **manipulate** attributes dynamically.
-   ✅ Gain **hands-on experience** through practical programming tasks.

### Lesson 4.2: Class Instance Methods (Part 1) 📌

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   What **instance methods** are and why they're essential in OOP.
-   How the `__init__()` method initializes new objects.
-   The purpose of the `self` argument.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand how **instance methods** work in Python.
-   ✅ Learn about the `__init__()` method and its role in object construction.
-   ✅ Know why the `self` keyword is essential.

### Lesson 4.3: Class Instance Methods (Part 2) 🔍

This lesson builds on the previous one, focusing on **real-world use cases** and **class design**.  
I will explore:

-   Structuring classes properly.
-   Writing and organizing instance methods.
-   Managing attributes and applying encapsulation.
-   Using classes to solve practical problems.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Know how to design and implement well-structured classes.
-   ✅ Understand the role of instance methods in **data management and behavior**.
-   ✅ Strengthen my coding skills with problem-solving tasks.

### Lesson 4.4: Access Modifiers and Accessors 🔐

This lesson covers:

-   Using **public**, **protected**, and **private** access modifiers.
-   Defining **getter** and **setter** methods.
-   Implementing **data encapsulation** and enforcing **data integrity**.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand access control in classes.
-   ✅ Know how to use **accessor methods** to manage internal state.
-   ✅ Protect data while keeping my code clean and maintainable.

### Lesson 4.5: Properties and the `property()` Function 🧩

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   How Python **properties** work.
-   The role of the **`property()` function**.
-   Creating **read-only** and **read-write** properties.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand how properties improve encapsulation and readability.
-   ✅ Replace manual accessors with more Pythonic alternatives.
-   ✅ Use `property()` to simplify my class interface.

### Lesson 4.6: The `@property` Decorator 🎨

In this lesson, I will dive deeper into:

-   The **`@property` decorator**.
-   Writing **Pythonic getters and setters** using decorators.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Use the `@property` decorator effectively.
-   ✅ Build clean, elegant APIs for my classes.
-   ✅ Create both read-only and read-write properties using decorators.

### Lesson 4.7: `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` Decorators 🧭

In this lesson, I will learn:

-   The **difference** between **instance methods**, **class methods**, and **static methods**.
-   How to use the `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators appropriately.
-   When to use each type of method.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Know how and when to use `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`.
-   ✅ Improve the flexibility and clarity of my class designs.
-   ✅ Write reusable methods that don’t depend on object instances.

### Lesson 4.8: `@singledispatchmethod` Decorator 🎯

This lesson introduces:

-   The **`@singledispatchmethod`** decorator from `functools`.
-   How to create **method overloading** based on argument types.
-   Real-world use cases of **generic function dispatching**.

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Understand the idea of **method overloading** in Python.
-   ✅ Use `@singledispatchmethod` to write more elegant and extensible code.
-   ✅ Build generic methods that adapt to different data types.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing Chapter 4, I will have mastered the foundational tools for managing class and object behavior in Python.
These skills will make my code more organized, maintainable, and powerful — preparing me for more advanced OOP topics and real-world applications.
