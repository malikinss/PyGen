1. 4_1_attributes_of_objects_and_classes

```
# Lesson 4.1: Attributes of Objects and Classes 🏛️
In this lesson, I will explore:
-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
-   Understanding the `dir()` function.
-   Differentiating between object attributes and class attributes.
-   Using the `__dict__` attribute.
-   Working with `getattr()`, `setattr()`, `hasattr()`, and `delattr()` functions.
This lesson provides a strong foundation for working with attributes in Python, helping me understand how objects and classes store and manage data.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between object and class attributes.
✅ Learn how to inspect and manipulate attributes dynamically.
✅ Gain hands-on experience with practical programming tasks.
```

2. 4_2_class_instance_methods_part_1

```
# Lesson 4.2: Class Instance Methods (Part 1) 📌
In this lesson, I will explore:
-   **Class instance methods** and their role in OOP.
-   The **`__init__()` method**, which initializes new objects.
-   The importance of the **`self` argument** in instance methods.

This lesson provides a strong foundation for understanding how classes create and manage instances in Python.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how instance methods work in Python.
✅ Learn about the **`__init__()` method** and its role in object initialization.
✅ Know why the **`self` argument** is essential for instance methods.
```

3. 4_3_class_instance_methods_part_2

```
# Lesson 4.3: Class Instance Methods (Part 2) 🔍
This lesson focuses on designing and implementing classes with instance methods.
It provides a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming by exploring real-world examples of class structures.
Topics covered:
-   Class design and structuring.
-   Implementing instance methods.
-   Handling attributes and encapsulation.
-   Various use cases for classes in simulations and utilities.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn how to design and implement classes effectively.
✅ Understand the role of instance methods in object-oriented programming.
✅ Gain hands-on experience with class-based problem-solving.
```

4. 4_4_access_modifiers_and_accessors

```
# Lesson 4.4: Access Modifiers and Accessors 🔐
This lesson covers:
-   **Access Modifiers** (public, private, and protected)
-   **Accessor Methods** (Getters and Setters)
-   How to **encapsulate data** and enforce **data integrity** in object-oriented programming.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the role of access modifiers in controlling access to class attributes.
✅ Learn how to use getters and setters to safely access and modify object data.
✅ Implement access control in practical programming tasks.
```

5. 4_5_properties_property_function

```
# Lesson 4.5: Properties and the `property()` Function 🧩
This lesson covers:
-   **Properties in Python**
-   The **`property()` function**
-   The **Property object** and how it improves encapsulation and readability
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the concept of properties in Python
✅ Learn how to use the built-in `property()` function
✅ Be able to create read-only and read-write properties
✅ Replace manual getters/setters with more Pythonic property syntax
```

6. 4_6_property_decorator

```
# Lesson 4.6: The `@property` Decorator 🎨
This lesson is focused on:
-   The **`@property` decorator** in Python
-   How to use the `@property` decorator to define properties that can be accessed like attributes
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the usage of the `@property` decorator in Python
✅ Learn how to make **getter** and **setter** methods more Pythonic
✅ Implement read-only and read-write properties using the decorator
✅ Enhance code readability and encapsulation in Python classes
```

7. 4_7_classmethod_staticmethod_decorators

```
# Lesson 4.7: The `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` Decorators 🏗️
This lesson is focused on:
-   **Instance Methods**: Methods that operate on an instance of the class
-   **Class Methods**: Methods that operate on the class itself rather than on an instance, created using the `@classmethod` decorator
-   **Static Methods**: Methods that don't depend on either the instance or the class, created using the `@staticmethod` decorator
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods
✅ Learn how to use `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators in Python
✅ Implement class and static methods for flexible class design and functionality
✅ Enhance code structure with more specialized methods
