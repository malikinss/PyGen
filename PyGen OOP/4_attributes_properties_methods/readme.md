# Lesson 4.1: Attributes of Objects and Classes 🏛️
In this lesson, I will explore:
-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
-   Understanding the `dir()` function.
-   Differentiating between object attributes and class attributes.
-   Using the `__dict__` attribute.
-   Working with `getattr()`, `setattr()`, `hasattr()`, and `delattr()` functions.
This lesson provides a strong foundation for working with attributes in Python, helping me understand how objects and classes store and manage data.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between object and class attributes.
✅ Learn how to inspect and manipulate attributes dynamically.
✅ Gain hands-on experience with practical programming tasks.
