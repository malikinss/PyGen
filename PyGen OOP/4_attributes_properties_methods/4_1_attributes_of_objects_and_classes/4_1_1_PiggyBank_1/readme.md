# PiggyBank Class Implementation 🏦

## Description 📝

The `PiggyBank` class represents a simple, empty class that serves as a foundation for implementing a savings container.
It currently has no attributes or methods but can be expanded to include functionality such as adding and withdrawing money.

## Purpose 🎯

This class is designed to demonstrate the creation of a basic class in Python.
It acts as a placeholder that can be further developed into a more functional piggy bank.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Class Definition**:

    - The `PiggyBank` class is created using the `class` keyword.
    - The `pass` statement is used to indicate that the class is empty.

2. **Instance Creation**:
    - A new instance of the `PiggyBank` class is created and assigned to the variable `money_box`.

## Output 📜

There is no direct output from this implementation, but the `money_box` instance exists and can be expanded with attributes or methods in the future.

## Usage 📦

1. Define the `PiggyBank` class.
2. Create an instance of `PiggyBank` and store it in the `money_box` variable.

## Conclusion 🚀

The `PiggyBank` class serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as adding methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
This implementation introduces the concept of class instantiation in Python.
