# Chapter 1: Intro to "Python Generation": OOP Course 📘

## Description 📝

Welcome to **Chapter 1** of the **"Python Generation: OOP"** course!
This chapter continues the journey from the **beginner**, **advanced** and **professionals** courses and dives deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python.
It will provide me with the knowledge of the core concepts like attributes, properties, methods, inheritance, and other advanced features in Python.

## Purpose 🎯

In this course, I will:

-   Learn about **attributes**, **properties**, and **methods** of classes.
-   Understand the mechanism of **class inheritance**.
-   Learn to write **functional classes**.
-   Work with the **`enum`** and **`dataclasses`** modules.
-   Master the use of **class decorators**.

## Course Structure 📚

The course consists of **10 modules**:

1. **About the course**
2. **Reviewing the main Python language constructs** 🐍
3. **Introduction to OOP**
4. **Attributes, properties, and methods**
5. **Magic methods**
6. **Protocols**
7. **Inheritance and polymorphism**
8. **Additional features**
9. **Class design tasks**
10. **Conclusion**

Each module is structured into several lessons, with each lesson focusing on one key concept.
The lessons are followed by **assignments**, which will help solidify my understanding of the material.
Although this chapter doesn’t include practical tasks, there are **4 theoretical questions** that will aid in reinforcing the learned concepts.

## Usage 📦

1. Go through the **notes** in each lesson.
2. Answer the **theoretical questions** at the end of the chapter.
3. Reflect on these concepts as preparation for the practical tasks in the following chapters.
