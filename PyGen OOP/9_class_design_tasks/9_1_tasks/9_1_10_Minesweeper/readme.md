# Game and Cell Class Implementation for Minesweeper

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `Game` and `Cell` classes to represent a Minesweeper game board.
The `Game` class creates a board with a specified number of rows, columns, and mines, randomly placing mines and initializing cells with their attributes.
The `Cell` class represents individual cells, storing their position, mine status, and the number of mines in neighboring cells.
The board is a 2D list of `Cell` instances, and mines are distributed randomly during initialization.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for game development, simulations, or educational examples of Python classes, random distribution, and 2D grid processing, particularly for implementing Minesweeper logic.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Game Class**:
    -   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
        -   Takes `rows`, `cols`, and `mines` as parameters.
        -   Stores `self.rows`, `self.cols`, and `self.mines`.
        -   Creates `self.board` by calling `_init_board`.
    -   **\_init_board**:
        -   Creates an empty board with `_create_empty_board`.
        -   Places mines randomly with `_place_mines`.
        -   Initializes neighbor counts for each cell by calling `_init_neighbours`.
        -   Returns the 2D list of `Cell` instances.
    -   **\_create_empty_board**:
        -   Generates a `rows x cols` board of `Cell` instances, each with `mine=False`.
    -   **\_place_mines**:
        -   Uses `random.sample` to select `mines` unique positions from all possible `(i, j)` coordinates.
        -   Sets `mine=True` for the selected cells.
-   **Cell Class**:
    -   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
        -   Takes `row`, `col`, and optional `mine` (defaults to `False`).
        -   Stores `self.row`, `self.col`, `self.mine`, and initializes `self.neighbours` to 0.
    -   **\_init_neighbours**:
        -   Counts mines in the 8 neighboring cells (if within bounds).
        -   Iterates over relative coordinates `[-1, 0, 1]` for rows and columns, excluding the cell itself.
        -   Sets `self.neighbours` to the count of neighboring mines.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   The `Game` instance creates a board with randomly placed mines.
    -   Each `Cell` knows its position (`row`, `col`), whether it has a mine (`mine`), and how many neighboring cells have mines (`neighbours`).
    -   The board is accessible via `game.board`, a 2D list of `Cell` instances.
    -   No validation is needed beyond ensuring the number of mines fits the board, as inputs are guaranteed correct.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Game Initialization**:
    -   Accepts `rows`, `cols`, `mines`.
    -   Example: `Game(14, 18, 40)` creates a 14x18 board with 40 mines.
-   **Game Attributes**:
    -   `rows`, `cols`, `mines` are accessible.
    -   Example: `game.rows` ‚Üí `14`, `game.cols` ‚Üí `18`, `game.mines` ‚Üí `40`.
    -   `board` is a 2D list with `rows` sublists, each containing `cols` `Cell` instances.
-   **Cell Attributes**:
    -   Each cell has `row`, `col`, `mine`, `neighbours`.
    -   Example: `game.board[0][0].row` ‚Üí `0`, `game.board[0][0].col` ‚Üí `0`, `game.board[0][0].mine` ‚Üí `True` or `False`, `game.board[0][0].neighbours` ‚Üí `0` to `8`.
    -   `neighbours` accurately counts mines in adjacent cells, compatible with `get_neighbours_count()`.
-   **Mine Placement**:
    -   Mines are placed randomly using `random.sample`.
    -   Exactly `mines` cells have `mine=True`.
    -   Remaining cells have `mine=False`.
-   **Neighbor Count**:
    -   Each cell‚Äôs `neighbours` attribute is set by counting mines in the 8 adjacent cells.
    -   Handles edge and corner cells correctly by checking bounds.
-   **Correctness**:
    -   Board dimensions match `rows` and `cols`.
    -   Mine count matches `mines`.
    -   Neighbor counts are calculated correctly.
    -   No validation needed, as inputs are guaranteed correct.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstrings with type hints.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:
    -   `random.sample` ensures exactly `mines` unique positions, avoiding duplicates.
    -   `_init_neighbours` correctly counts mines in the 3x3 grid around each cell, excluding the cell itself.
    -   Bounds checking (`0 <= ni < rows`, `0 <= nj < cols`) prevents index errors for edge/corner cells.
    -   `Cell` initialization with `mine=False` ensures all cells start without mines until `_place_mines`.
-   **Performance**:
    -   Initialization: O(rows _ cols) for board creation, O(mines) for mine placement, O(rows _ cols) for neighbor calculation.
    -   Total: O(rows \* cols) for setup.
    -   Accessing attributes: O(1).
    -   Efficient for typical Minesweeper board sizes (e.g., 14x18).
-   **Design**:
    -   Two-class structure (`Game`, `Cell`) clearly separates board and cell responsibilities.
    -   Type hints (`List`, `int`, `'Cell'`) clarify signatures.
    -   Modular methods (`_create_empty_board`, `_place_mines`, `_init_neighbours`) improve readability.
    -   Random mine placement uses `random.sample` for simplicity and correctness.
-   **Alternatives**:
    -   Flat list for board: Less intuitive than 2D list for grid access.
    -   Precompute all positions: Unnecessary, as `random.sample` is efficient.
    -   Store neighbor count in `Game`: Less encapsulated than in `Cell`.
-   **Extensibility**:
    -   Easily extended to support game logic (e.g., revealing cells, flagging mines).
    -   Could add validation (e.g., `mines <= rows * cols`) if needed.
-   **Edge Cases**:
    -   Zero mines: Valid, all cells have `mine=False`.
    -   Maximum mines (`rows * cols`): Valid, all cells have `mine=True`.
    -   Corner/edge cells: Neighbor counts correctly exclude out-of-bounds cells.
    -   Small board (e.g., 1x1): Handled correctly with proper neighbor counts.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Create a game
game = Game(14, 18, 40)

# Check attributes
print(game.rows)  # 14
print(game.cols)  # 18
print(game.mines)  # 40

# Check a cell
cell = game.board[0][0]
print(cell.row)  # 0
print(cell.col)  # 0
print(cell.mine)  # True or False
print(cell.neighbours)  # 0 to 8, depending on nearby mines

# Example small board for visualization
small_game = Game(3, 3, 2)
for row in small_game.board:
    for cell in row:
        print(f"({cell.row},{cell.col}): mine={cell.mine}, "
              f"neighbours={cell.neighbours}")
# Possible output (random):
# (0,0): mine=False, neighbours=1
# (0,1): mine=True, neighbours=0
# (0,2): mine=False, neighbours=1
# ...

# Check neighbor consistency
for i in range(small_game.rows):
    for j in range(small_game.cols):
        cell = small_game.board[i][j]
        # Assume get_neighbours_count() counts mines in adjacent cells
        assert cell.neighbours == get_neighbours_count(small_game.board, i, j)
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `Game` and `Cell` class implementations are precise, correctly representing a Minesweeper board with random mine placement and accurate neighbor counts.
The `Game` class manages board creation and mine distribution, while the `Cell` class encapsulates cell properties.
The implementation is efficient, extensible, and ideal for Minesweeper simulations or teaching grid-based game logic, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
