TODO:
    Implement the ArithmeticProgression class to generate the terms of
    the arithmetic progression.

    When creating an instance of the ArithmeticProgression class, the first
    term of the sequence and the difference of the progression must be
    specified:
        progression = ArithmeticProgression(0, 1)
        for elem in progression:
        if elem > 10:
        break
        print(elem, end=' ') # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

    Note that the arithmetic progression must be iterable and also infinite.

    Similarly, implement the GeometricProgression class to generate the terms
    of the geometric progression.

    When creating an instance of the GeometricProgression class, the first
    member of the sequence and the denominator of the progression must be
    specified:
        progression = GeometricProgression(1, 2)
        for elem in progression:
        if elem > 10:
        break
        print(elem, end=' ') # 1 2 4 8

    A geometric progression, like an arithmetic one, must be iterable and also
    infinite.
