1. 9_1_1_anything

```
# anything() Function and Anything Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `anything()` function, which returns an instance of the `Anything` class.
The `Anything` class overrides all comparison magic methods (`__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`) to return `True` for any comparison operation (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) with any other object.
This ensures that any comparison involving an `Anything` instance always evaluates to `True`.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for scenarios requiring a universal comparator, such as testing, mocking, or educational examples of Python magic methods, comparison operations, and custom object behavior.

2. 9_1_2_Vector

```
# Vector Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `Vector` class, which represents a vector of arbitrary dimension in a coordinate space.
It supports initialization with any number of coordinates, informal string representation, vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, normalization), and equality comparisons.
The class raises a `ValueError` with the message "Vectors must have equal length" when operations are attempted on vectors of different dimensions.
The implementation uses Python’s operator overloading and functional programming techniques for concise operation handling.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for applications involving vector mathematics, such as physics simulations, computer graphics, or educational examples of Python classes, operator overloading, and mathematical operations.

3. 9_1_3_CaesarCipher

```
# CaesarCipher Class Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `CaesarCipher` class, which encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift.
The class supports encryption via the `encode()` method (shifting letters to the right) and decryption via the `decode()` method (shifting letters to the left).
It preserves the case of letters, only processes Latin letters (a-z, A-Z), and leaves non-letter characters unchanged.
The implementation uses a helper method `_code` to handle the core transformation logic for both encryption and decryption.

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for applications requiring simple text encryption/decryption, such as educational exercises, basic security demonstrations, or puzzles involving the Caesar cipher.
