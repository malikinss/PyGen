# Lesson 9.1: Final Tasks 🏆

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on applying a wide range of Python programming concepts through practical tasks, serving as a capstone for previous lessons.

This lesson includes 13 programming practical tasks with no theoretical explanation or questions, emphasizing hands-on application of Python skills.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Apply object-oriented programming, exception handling, and advanced Python features  
✅ Solve complex problems using classes, decorators, and data structures  
✅ Implement real-world scenarios like games, ciphers, and state management  
✅ Demonstrate proficiency in Python through diverse, practical tasks

## Practical Task 🧪

### 1️⃣ **Comprehensive Programming Challenges**

The lesson includes 13 practical tasks, each testing different Python skills:

1. **`anything` Function and `Anything` Class**: Universal comparator.

    - Returns `True` for all comparison operations.

2. **`Vector` Class**: Vector mathematics.

    - Supports addition, subtraction, dot product, and normalization.

3. **`CaesarCipher` Class**: Text encryption/decryption.

    - Implements Caesar cipher with case preservation.

4. **`ArithmeticProgression` and `GeometricProgression` Classes**: Sequence generators.

    - Infinite iterables for arithmetic and geometric progressions.

5. **`DomainException` and `Domain` Classes**: Domain validation.

    - Extracts and validates domains from URLs/emails.

6. **`HighScoreTable` Class**: Game leaderboard.

    - Manages top scores with limited capacity.

7. **`Pagination` Class**: Data pagination.

    - Splits lists into pages with navigation and method chaining.

8. **`Testpaper` and `Student` Classes**: Exam simulation.

    - Tracks test results with pass/fail outcomes.

9. **`TicTacToe` Class**: 3x3 game simulation.

    - Handles moves, win/draw detection, and board display.

10. **`Game` and `Cell` Classes**: Minesweeper board.

    - Manages grid with random mines and neighbor counts.

11. **`Selfie` Class**: State management.

    - Saves and restores instance states with deep copying.

12. **`MultiKeyDict` Class**: Dictionary with aliases.

    - Supports key aliases via `UserDict` with precedence rules.

13. **`predicate` Decorator**: Logical predicate combinations.
    - Enables `&`, `|`, `~` operations on boolean functions.

💡 These tasks cover a broad spectrum of Python concepts, from OOP to functional programming.

## Benefits ✅

-   Reinforces skills in classes, inheritance, and operator overloading.
-   Enhances problem-solving with real-world scenarios like games and ciphers.
-   Builds confidence in handling complex data structures and logic.
-   Prepares for practical Python application in diverse domains.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I now:  
✅ Design and implement complex Python classes and decorators  
✅ Solve diverse problems like games, encryption, and pagination  
✅ Apply advanced techniques like state management and predicate logic

## Conclusion 🚀

Completing these final tasks solidifies my Python expertise, enabling me to tackle real-world challenges.  
From Tic-Tac-Toe to predicate decorators, I’ve built versatile, robust solutions, ready for advanced Python applications. 🧑‍💻✨
