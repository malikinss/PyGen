# Python Generation: OOP Course 📚

## Description 📝

Welcome to the **Python Generation: OOP Course**!  
This course is a continuation of the **Python Generation** series, including courses for beginners, advanced users, and professionals, designed for those who want to master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with `Python`.  
I will explore key OOP concepts, including attributes, properties, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, protocols, and advanced features like `enum`, `dataclasses`, and class decorators.

By the end of this course, I will have developed professional `Python OOP` programming skills and be capable of designing and implementing robust, modular, and reusable code for real-world applications.

The course includes **231 practical programming tasks** and **552 theoretical questions**, ensuring hands-on experience and a deep understanding of each topic.

Upon successful completion, I will receive a **certificate of completion** ![Certificate](./pygen_oop_certificate.png), validating my expertise in `Python OOP` programming.

## Purpose 🎯

The course aims to:

-   Strengthen my knowledge of `Python`’s OOP principles and best practices.
-   Introduce core OOP concepts such as attributes, properties, methods, inheritance, and polymorphism.
-   Teach me how to work with advanced features like `enum`, `dataclasses`, and class decorators.
-   Help me master protocols, magic methods, and advanced class design techniques.
-   Provide practical problem-solving skills through challenging tasks and assessments.
-   Prepare me for real-world `Python` applications and further professional development in OOP.
