# Chapter 1: Intro to "Python Generation": OOP Course üìò
Welcome to **Chapter 1** of the **"Python Generation: OOP"** course!
This chapter continues the journey from the **beginner**, **advanced** and **professionals** courses and dives deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python.
It will provide me with the knowledge of the core concepts like attributes, properties, methods, inheritance, and other advanced features in Python.
In this course, I will:
-   Learn about **attributes**, **properties**, and **methods** of classes.
-   Understand the mechanism of **class inheritance**.
-   Learn to write **functional classes**.
-   Work with the **`enum`** and **`dataclasses`** modules.
-   Master the use of **class decorators**.
```

2. 2_basic_python_constructs

```
# Chapter 2: Review of Python's Basic Constructs üìò
In **Chapter 2**, I will revisit the essential Python constructs by applying them in **practical tasks**.
This chapter helps to reinforce my understanding of **loops**, **conditionals**, **decorators**, and **functions** through **hands-on coding** challenges.
By working on 15 tasks, I will practice and solidify the core concepts that are vital for mastering Python.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   ‚úÖ Gain experience in **solving real-world problems** using Python
-   ‚úÖ Understand how to use **basic Python constructs** effectively
-   ‚úÖ Practice using **decorators**, **loops**, and **conditionals** in real scenarios
```

3. 3_oop_introduction

```
# Chapter 3: Introduction to OOP üìò
Chapter 3 dives into the heart of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. In this chapter, I will introduce the core concepts of OOP, compare it with procedural programming, and explore the foundational principles that shape the way I design and build software.
By understanding these principles, I will gain the necessary skills to start writing maintainable and reusable code.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
-   Understand how **OOP** differs from **procedural programming**.
-   Explore key principles of OOP, including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
-   Understand how to apply these principles to solve real-world programming problems.
```

4. 4_attributes_properties_methods

```
# Chapter 4: Attributes, Properties, and Methods üß†
This chapter is dedicated to deepening **my understanding of classes and objects** in Python by learning how to define, access, and control **attributes**, as well as how to use **methods** and **decorators** to structure my code more efficiently.
It consists of **8 detailed lessons** with solid theoretical explanations, **38 hands-on coding tasks**, and **98 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn how to work with **object and class attributes**.
-   Understand the difference between **instance methods**, **class methods**, and **static methods**.
-   Use **access modifiers**, **accessors**, and **property decorators** to enforce data encapsulation and maintain clean code.
-   Practice building real-world classes and designing flexible, reusable objects.
```

5. 5_magical_methods

```
# Chapter 5: Magic Methods ‚ú®
This chapter is dedicated to mastering **magic methods** in Python, enabling me to customize the behavior of objects and make them more intuitive and powerful.
It consists of **11 comprehensive lessons** with in-depth theoretical explanations, **46 hands-on programming tasks**, and **131 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn how to use **magic methods** to control object creation, representation, and behavior.
-   Understand how to implement **custom operators**, **type conversions**, and **attribute access**.
-   Explore **hashing** and its role in creating hashable objects for dictionaries and sets.
-   Practice building flexible and reusable classes with real-world applications.
```

6. 6_protocols

```
# Chapter 6: Protocols üõ†Ô∏è
This chapter is dedicated to mastering **Python protocols**, enabling me to implement custom behavior for objects using specialized magic methods.
It consists of **8 comprehensive lessons** with detailed theoretical explanations, **42 hands-on programming tasks**, and **96 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn how to implement **protocols** like iterable, sequence, context manager, and descriptor protocols.
-   Understand how to use **magic methods** to customize object behavior for iteration, resource management, and attribute access.
-   Practice building reusable and flexible classes for real-world applications like data processing, file handling, and attribute validation.
-   Enhance my ability to integrate custom objects seamlessly with Python‚Äôs ecosystem.
```

7. 7_inheritance_and_polymorphism

```
# Chapter 7: Inheritance and Polymorphism üß¨
This chapter is dedicated to mastering **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in Python, enabling me to create flexible, reusable, and well-structured class hierarchies.
It consists of **8 comprehensive lessons** with in-depth theoretical explanations, **49 hands-on programming tasks**, and **113 theoretical questions** available on the course platform.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn how to use **inheritance** to build class hierarchies and extend functionality.
-   Understand **polymorphism** to create flexible and interchangeable objects.
-   Explore **abstract classes**, **multiple inheritance**, and **composition** for advanced object-oriented design.
-   Practice designing modular and reusable classes for real-world applications.
