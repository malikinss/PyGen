# Chapter 1: Intro to "Python Generation": OOP Course 📘
Welcome to **Chapter 1** of the **"Python Generation: OOP"** course!
This chapter continues the journey from the **beginner**, **advanced** and **professionals** courses and dives deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python.
It will provide me with the knowledge of the core concepts like attributes, properties, methods, inheritance, and other advanced features in Python.
In this course, I will:
-   Learn about **attributes**, **properties**, and **methods** of classes.
-   Understand the mechanism of **class inheritance**.
-   Learn to write **functional classes**.
-   Work with the **`enum`** and **`dataclasses`** modules.
-   Master the use of **class decorators**.
```

2. 2_basic_python_constructs

```
# Chapter 2: Review of Python's Basic Constructs 📘
In **Chapter 2**, I will revisit the essential Python constructs by applying them in **practical tasks**.
This chapter helps to reinforce my understanding of **loops**, **conditionals**, **decorators**, and **functions** through **hands-on coding** challenges.
By working on 15 tasks, I will practice and solidify the core concepts that are vital for mastering Python.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   ✅ Gain experience in **solving real-world problems** using Python
-   ✅ Understand how to use **basic Python constructs** effectively
-   ✅ Practice using **decorators**, **loops**, and **conditionals** in real scenarios
```

# Chapter 3: Introduction to OOP 📘
Chapter 3 dives into the heart of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. In this chapter, I will introduce the core concepts of OOP, compare it with procedural programming, and explore the foundational principles that shape the way I design and build software.
By understanding these principles, I will gain the necessary skills to start writing maintainable and reusable code.
In this chapter, I will:
-   Learn the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
-   Understand how **OOP** differs from **procedural programming**.
-   Explore key principles of OOP, including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
-   Understand how to apply these principles to solve real-world programming problems.
