# Chapter 2: Review of Python's Basic Constructs 📘

## Description 📝

In **Chapter 2**, I will revisit the essential Python constructs by applying them in **practical tasks**.
This chapter helps to reinforce my understanding of **loops**, **conditionals**, **decorators**, and **functions** through **hands-on coding** challenges.
By working on 15 tasks, I will practice and solidify the core concepts that are vital for mastering Python.

### What I will explore in this lesson:

-   ✅ 15 **practical Python tasks**
-   ✅ Working with **decorators**, **conditionals**, and **functions**
-   ✅ **Validating inputs** and **generating useful data**

This lesson aims to enhance my **problem-solving skills** and improve my **coding efficiency**.
Each task has been carefully designed to reinforce fundamental Python constructs and set the stage for more complex challenges.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   ✅ Gain experience in **solving real-world problems** using Python
-   ✅ Understand how to use **basic Python constructs** effectively
-   ✅ Practice using **decorators**, **loops**, and **conditionals** in real scenarios

## Usage 📦

1. Review the **15 practical tasks**.
2. Focus on using **loops**, **decorators**, **conditionals**, and **functions** to solve each task.
3. Complete the tasks by validating **inputs** and **generating data**.
4. Apply my knowledge from this chapter to **solve real-world coding problems** more efficiently.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of Chapter 2, I will have sharpened my skills in Python's basic constructs.
This chapter prepares me for tackling more advanced topics in the next sections of the course, where I'll begin to work with Object-Oriented Programming and more intricate coding challenges.
