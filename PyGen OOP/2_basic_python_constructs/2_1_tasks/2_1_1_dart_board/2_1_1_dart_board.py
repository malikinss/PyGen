TODO:
    We will assume that the playing field for darts is a square matrix filled
    with natural numbers arranged in ascending order from the edges to
    the center.

    The side of the playing field is the side of the square matrix that this
    field represents.

    Write a program that creates a darts field of a certain size.

    The program receives a single natural number as input â€” the side of the
    playing field.

    The program must create and output a playing field with a given side.

NOTE:
    It is guaranteed that the side of the playing field does not exceed 18.
