TODO:
        Arthur has a small collection of Pokemon cards, some of which
        are duplicates.
        He wants to keep one card of each type and sell the rest.

        Write a program that determines how many duplicates Arthur can
        sell from his collection.

        Input:
            The program receives an arbitrary number of lines
            representing a collection of Pokemon cards.
            Each line contains the name of a Pokemon from the card.

        Output:
            The program should output a single number â€” the number of
            cards that can be sold from this collection to keep one card
            of each type.
