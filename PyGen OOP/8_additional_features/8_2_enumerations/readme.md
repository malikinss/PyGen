# HTTPStatusCodes Enum Implementation

## Description 📝

The provided code implements the `HTTPStatusCodes` class as a Python enumeration using `enum.Enum`.
It defines five HTTP status codes (`CONTINUE`, `OK`, `USE_PROXY`, `NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_GATEWAY`) with their respective values (100, 200, 305, 404, 502).
Each enum element supports two methods: `info()` to return the element’s name and value as a tuple, and `code_class()` to return the Russian name of the status code’s group (e.g., информация, успех).

## Purpose 🎯

Intended for applications involving HTTP request handling, such as web servers, APIs, or educational examples of Python enumerations, status code management, and method implementation on enum elements.
