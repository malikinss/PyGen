1. 8_2_1_HTTPStatusCodes

```
# HTTPStatusCodes Enum Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `HTTPStatusCodes` class as a Python enumeration using `enum.Enum`.
It defines five HTTP status codes (`CONTINUE`, `OK`, `USE_PROXY`, `NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_GATEWAY`) with their respective values (100, 200, 305, 404, 502).
Each enum element supports two methods: `info()` to return the element‚Äôs name and value as a tuple, and `code_class()` to return the Russian name of the status code‚Äôs group (e.g., –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è, —É—Å–ø–µ—Ö).

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications involving HTTP request handling, such as web servers, APIs, or educational examples of Python enumerations, status code management, and method implementation on enum elements.

2. 8_2_2_Seasons

```
# Seasons Enum Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `Seasons` class as a Python enumeration using `enum.Enum`.
It defines four seasons (`WINTER`, `SPRING`, `SUMMER`, `FALL`) with values 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Each enum element supports a `text_value` method that returns the season‚Äôs name in English (`en`) or Russian (`ru`), with specific translations for each season.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring localized season names, such as calendars, weather apps, or educational examples of Python enumerations, method implementation on enum elements, and internationalization.
