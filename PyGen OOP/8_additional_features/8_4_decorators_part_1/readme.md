# reverse_args Decorator Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `reverse_args` decorator as a class that reverses the order of positional arguments passed to a decorated function.
The decorator uses `functools.update_wrapper` to preserve the metadata of the decorated function and supports functions with any number of positional and keyword arguments, ensuring the function‚Äôs return value is passed through unchanged.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios requiring argument order manipulation, such as testing, debugging, or educational examples of Python decorators, callable classes, and metadata preservation.
