# Lesson 8.6: Dataclasses Module 🗂️

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   Data classes in Python
-   The `dataclasses` module
-   The `@dataclass` decorator for automatic method generation

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 4 programming practical tasks, and 22 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Understand the role of data classes in simplifying class design  
✅ Use the `@dataclass` decorator to automate method generation  
✅ Implement data classes with custom initialization and comparison  
✅ Apply data classes to practical scenarios like city and team data

## Concepts & Theory 🔍

### 🔹 Data Classes

-   **Purpose**: Streamline class definitions for data storage and manipulation.
-   **Benefits**: Reduce boilerplate code for `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.

### 🔹 Module `dataclasses`

-   **Purpose**: Provides tools for creating data classes.
-   **Features**: Includes `@dataclass` decorator and `field` for attribute customization.

### 🔹 Decorator `@dataclass`

-   **Purpose**: Automatically generates special methods for a class.
-   **Options**: Supports `frozen=True` for immutability, custom comparisons, and more.

## Practical Task 🧪

### 1️⃣ **Data Class Implementations**

The lesson includes 4 practical tasks, each implementing data classes:

1. **`City` Data Class**: Represents city data.

    - Attributes: `name`, `population`, `founded`; auto-generated methods.

2. **`MusicAlbum` Data Class**: Immutable music album.

    - Attributes: `title`, `artist`, `genre`, `year`; custom `__repr__` and `__eq__`.

3. **`Point` Data Class**: 2D point with quadrant.

    - Attributes: `x`, `y`, `quadrant`; computed `quadrant` via `__post_init__`.

4. **`FootballPlayer` and `FootballTeam` Data Classes**: Sports data.
    - `FootballPlayer`: `name`, `surname`, `value`; `FootballTeam`: `name`, `players`.

💡 These tasks showcase data classes for structured data with minimal boilerplate.

## Benefits ✅

-   `@dataclass` reduces repetitive code for initialization and representation.
-   Immutability (`frozen=True`) ensures data integrity.
-   Customizable comparisons and fields support flexible designs.
-   Data classes simplify management of structured data.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I now:  
✅ Create data classes with `@dataclass` for efficient class design  
✅ Customize data classes with computed fields and immutability  
✅ Apply data classes to practical use cases like geometric points and sports teams

## Conclusion 🚀

Mastering the `dataclasses` module empowers me to create concise, robust Python classes.  
From city data to football teams, data classes streamline structured data management, enhancing code clarity and maintainability. 🧑‍💻✨
