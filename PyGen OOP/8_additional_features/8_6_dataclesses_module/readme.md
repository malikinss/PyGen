# City Data Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `City` class as a Python data class using the `@dataclass` decorator.
It defines a city with three attributes: `name` (string), `population` (integer), and `founded` (integer).
The data class automatically generates an `__init__` method to initialize these attributes, a `__repr__` method for a formal string representation, and an `__eq__` method for equality comparison, meeting all specified requirements.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring structured representation of city data, such as geographic information systems, data analysis, or educational examples of Python data classes, automatic method generation, and comparison operations.
