This lesson has good theory explonation, has 4 programing practical tasks and 22 theoretical questions presented on the website.

1. 8_6_1_City

```
# City Data Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `City` class as a Python data class using the `@dataclass` decorator.
It defines a city with three attributes: `name` (string), `population` (integer), and `founded` (integer).
The data class automatically generates an `__init__` method to initialize these attributes, a `__repr__` method for a formal string representation, and an `__eq__` method for equality comparison, meeting all specified requirements.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring structured representation of city data, such as geographic information systems, data analysis, or educational examples of Python data classes, automatic method generation, and comparison operations.

2. 8_6_2_MusicAlbum

```
# MusicAlbum Data Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `MusicAlbum` class as an immutable Python data class using the `@dataclass(frozen=True)` decorator.
It defines a music album with four attributes: `title` (string), `artist` (string), `genre` (string), and `year` (integer).
The data class automatically generates an `__init__` method to initialize these attributes, a `__repr__` method for a formal string representation, and an `__eq__` method for equality comparison based on `title`, `artist`, and `year`.
The `frozen=True` parameter ensures immutability, and `field` settings exclude `genre` and `year` from `__repr__` and `genre` from `__eq__` as required.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring structured, immutable representations of music albums, such as music libraries, catalog systems, or educational examples of Python data classes, immutability, and custom comparison logic.
```

3. 8_6_3_Point

```
# Point Data Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `Point` class as a Python data class using the `@dataclass` decorator.
It represents a point on a coordinate plane with attributes `x` (float), `y` (float), and `quadrant` (int).
The class accepts `x` and `y` coordinates with default values of `0.0`, computes the `quadrant` automatically, provides methods for symmetry about the x- and y-axes, and supports equality comparisons.
The implementation uses `dataclasses.field` to configure `quadrant` and includes a `__post_init__` method to compute the quadrant based on coordinates.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications involving geometric computations, such as graphics, simulations, or educational examples of Python data classes, coordinate geometry, and custom attribute initialization.
