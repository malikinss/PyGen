# OrderStatus Flag Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `OrderStatus` class as a Python flag enumeration using `enum.Flag`.
It defines three elements (`ORDER_PLACED`, `PAYMENT_RECEIVED`, `SHIPPING_COMPLETE`) with automatically assigned values via `auto()`.
As a `Flag`, it supports bitwise operations to represent combinations of order states.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications tracking online order progress, such as e-commerce systems, order management, or educational examples of Python flag enumerations and bitwise operations.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Flag Definition**:
    -   Inherits from `Flag` to create a flag enumeration.
    -   Defines three elements:
        -   `ORDER_PLACED`
        -   `PAYMENT_RECEIVED`
        -   `SHIPPING_COMPLETE`
    -   Uses `auto()` to automatically assign unique powers of 2 (typically 1, 2, 4).
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Each element is a flag with a unique bit value (e.g., `ORDER_PLACED=1`, `PAYMENT_RECEIVED=2`, `SHIPPING_COMPLETE=4`).
    -   Supports bitwise operations (e.g., `|` for combining, `&` for checking).
    -   No validation is performed, as inputs are guaranteed correct.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Flag Elements**:
    -   `OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED` exists with a value (typically 1).
    -   `OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED` exists with a value (typically 2).
    -   `OrderStatus.SHIPPING_COMPLETE` exists with a value (typically 4).
-   **Flag Behavior**:
    -   `OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED | OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED` creates a combined flag.
    -   `OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED in (OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED | OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED)` ‚Üí `True`.
    -   Elements are unique and combinable via bitwise operations.
-   **Correctness**:
    -   Defines exactly three elements as specified.
    -   `Flag` ensures elements are suitable for state tracking.
    -   No validation needed per requirements.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstring.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:
    -   `Flag` with `auto()` assigns unique powers of 2, ideal for state combinations.
    -   Elements are immutable and distinct, meeting requirements.
-   **Performance**:
    -   Initialization: O(1) for flag creation.
    -   Bitwise operations: O(1).
    -   Highly efficient for all operations.
-   **Design**:
    -   `Flag` is perfect for representing combinable states like order statuses.
    -   `auto()` simplifies value assignment without needing explicit values.
    -   Minimal implementation avoids complexity.
-   **Alternatives**:
    -   `Enum`: Not suitable, as it doesn‚Äôt support bitwise combinations.
    -   Class with constants: Less robust, no flag benefits (e.g., bitwise operations).
    -   Explicit values (e.g., 1, 2, 4): Unnecessary, as `auto()` handles this.
-   **Extensibility**:
    -   Easily extended by adding more flags (e.g., `DELIVERED`).
    -   Could add methods (e.g., status description) if needed.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Test flag elements
print(OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED)  # OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED
print(OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED.value)  # 1 (typically)

# Combine flags
status = OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED | OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED
print(status)  # OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED|PAYMENT_RECEIVED

# Check membership
print(OrderStatus.PAYMENT_RECEIVED in status)  # True
print(OrderStatus.SHIPPING_COMPLETE in status)  # False

# Add another status
status |= OrderStatus.SHIPPING_COMPLETE
print(status)  # OrderStatus.ORDER_PLACED|PAYMENT_RECEIVED|SHIPPING_COMPLETE
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `OrderStatus` implementation is precise, providing a robust flag enumeration for online order states.
The use of `Flag` with `auto()` ensures simplicity, type safety, and support for bitwise combinations.
The design is efficient and extensible, making it ideal for order tracking or teaching flag enumerations, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
