# track_instances Decorator Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `track_instances` decorator as a function that decorates a class to track all its instances in a class-level `instances` attribute.
The decorator wraps the class‚Äôs `__init__` method to append each new instance to the `instances` list after initialization, preserving the order of creation.
It uses `functools.wraps` to maintain the original `__init__` method‚Äôs metadata and supports classes with arbitrary `__init__` arguments.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios requiring instance tracking, such as debugging, monitoring object creation, or educational examples of Python class decorators, instance management, and method wrapping.
