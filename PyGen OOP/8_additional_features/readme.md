# Lesson 8.1: Slots and Attribute **slots** ⚙️

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   Slots in Python
-   The `__slots__` attribute for attribute restriction
-   Slots in inheritance
-   Performance comparison of slots versus regular attributes

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 1 programming practical task, and 11 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the purpose and mechanics of `__slots__`
✅ Implement classes with `__slots__` to restrict attributes
✅ Recognize the impact of slots on inheritance and performance
✅ Apply slots in practical scenarios for memory optimization
```

2. 8_2_enumerations

# Lesson 8.2: Enumerations and Class Enum 📋

## Description 📝

This lesson covers:

-   Enumerations in Python
-   Creating enumerations with the `Enum` class
-   Capabilities and features of enumerations

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 3 programming practical tasks, and 21 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the purpose and structure of enumerations
✅ Create and use enumerations with `Enum` for type-safe constants
✅ Implement methods on enum elements for custom behavior
✅ Apply enumerations to practical scenarios like HTTP codes and date scheduling
