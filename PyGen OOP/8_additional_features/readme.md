-   ✅ Use the **`@dataclass`** decorator to automate method generation.
-   ✅ Implement data classes with custom initialization and comparison.
-   ✅ Apply data classes to practical scenarios like city and team data.

### Lesson 8.7: Mixins 🧩

In this lesson, I will explore:

-   Mixins in Python.
-   Scenarios for using mixins.
-   Issues and considerations when using mixins.

By the end of this lesson, I will:
