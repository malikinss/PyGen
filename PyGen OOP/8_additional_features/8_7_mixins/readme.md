# JsonSerializableMixin Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `JsonSerializableMixin` class, a mixin that adds JSON serialization functionality to classes.
It defines a single method, `to_json()`, which returns a JSON-formatted string by serializing the instance‚Äôs attribute dictionary using `json.dumps`.
The implementation is simple, leveraging Python‚Äôs `json` module to handle serialization and the instance‚Äôs `__dict__` to access attributes.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring JSON serialization of class instances, such as API development, data interchange, or educational examples of Python mixins, JSON handling, and instance attribute serialization.
