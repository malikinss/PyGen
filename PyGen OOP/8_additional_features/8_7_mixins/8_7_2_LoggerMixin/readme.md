# LoggerMixin Class Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `LoggerMixin` class, a mixin that adds logging functionality to classes.
It defines a single method, `log()`, which takes a logging level and message as arguments and prints a formatted log entry.
The log entry includes the current date and time in `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` format, the logging level, the class name, and the message, following the specified format: `[<date and time>] - <level> - <class name>: <message>`.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for applications requiring logging capabilities, such as debugging, event tracking, or educational examples of Python mixins, datetime formatting, and class-based logging.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Class Definition**:
    -   `LoggerMixin` is a class designed to be inherited by other classes as a mixin.
    -   Defines a class variable `DT_FORMAT: str = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S"` for the datetime format (`DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS`).
-   **log Method**:
    -   Takes two arguments:
        -   `level: str`: The logging level (e.g., `INFO`, `ERROR`).
        -   `message: str`: The message text to log.
    -   Uses `datetime.now()` to get the current timestamp.
    -   Formats the timestamp using `strftime(self.DT_FORMAT)` to match `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS`.
    -   Retrieves the class name via `self.__class__.__name__`.
    -   Prints a formatted string: `[<formatted timestamp>] - <level> - <class name>: <message>`.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Outputs log messages to the console in the specified format.
    -   Uses the inheriting class‚Äôs name dynamically.
    -   No validation is performed, as inputs are guaranteed correct.
    -   Designed as a mixin, so it must be used with multiple inheritance in classes needing logging.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Mixin Class**:
    -   `LoggerMixin` is a class with a single method, `log()`, suitable for use as a mixin.
-   **log Method**:
    -   Accepts `level` and `message` as arguments.
    -   Outputs a string in the format: `[<DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS>] - <level> - <class name>: <message>`.
    -   Example: For a class `MyClass`, `log("INFO", "Started")` might output `[03.05.2025 14:30:00] - INFO - MyClass: Started`.
-   **Date and Time**:
    -   Uses `datetime.now()` formatted as `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `03.05.2025 14:30:00`).
    -   Matches the required format exactly.
-   **Correctness**:
    -   `self.__class__.__name__` dynamically retrieves the inheriting class‚Äôs name.
    -   `print` outputs the log message as required.
    -   No validation needed, as inputs are guaranteed correct.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstring with type hints.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:
    -   `datetime.now().strftime(self.DT_FORMAT)` correctly formats the timestamp as `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS`.
    -   `self.__class__.__name__` ensures the correct class name is used, even with inheritance.
    -   The format string matches the specified pattern exactly.
-   **Performance**:
    -   `log`: O(1) for timestamp generation, string formatting, and printing.
    -   Highly efficient for logging operations.
-   **Design**:
    -   Mixin design is appropriate for adding logging to multiple classes.
    -   `DT_FORMAT` as a class variable allows easy customization.
    -   Type hints (`str`) clarify method arguments.
    -   Using `print` aligns with typical logging output for simplicity.
-   **Alternatives**:
    -   Logging to a file or logger: Possible but not required, as console output is sufficient.
    -   Using `logging` module: More complex and unnecessary for this task.
    -   Custom timestamp logic: Unneeded, as `datetime` handles formatting robustly.
-   **Extensibility**:
    -   Easily extended to support additional logging destinations (e.g., files).
    -   Could add validation or log level filtering if needed.
-   **Edge Cases**:
    -   Empty `level` or `message`: Handled correctly, as no validation required.
    -   Special characters in `message`: Printed as-is, which is acceptable.
    -   Multiple inheritance: `self.__class__.__name__` uses the most specific class name.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Example class using the mixin
class Server(LoggerMixin):
    def __init__(self, host: str):
        self.host = host

    def start(self):
        self.log("INFO", f"Server started on {self.host}")

# Create instance and test logging
server = Server("localhost")
server.start()  # [03.05.2025 14:30:00] - INFO - Server: Server started on localhost

# Example with different class and log level
class Database(LoggerMixin):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

    def connect(self):
        self.log("ERROR", "Connection failed")

db = Database("main")
db.connect()  # [03.05.2025 14:30:01] - ERROR - Database: Connection failed
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `LoggerMixin` implementation is precise, providing a simple and effective way to add logging functionality via the `log()` method.
It correctly formats log messages with the current timestamp, level, class name, and message, using `datetime` for robust date handling.
The mixin is efficient, extensible, and designed for easy integration via inheritance, making it ideal for logging tasks or teaching mixin concepts, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
