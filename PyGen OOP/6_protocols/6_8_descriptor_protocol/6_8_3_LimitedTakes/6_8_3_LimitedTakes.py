TODO:
    Implement a LimitedTakes class that describes a descriptor that allows
    the attribute value to be retrieved only a certain number of times.

    When instantiated, the class must accept one argument:
        times â€” the number of times the attribute can be accessed

    The descriptor must be assigned to an attribute that has the same name
    as the variable to which the descriptor is assigned.

    When accessing an attribute, the descriptor must return the value
    of that attribute, if it is set.

    If the attribute value is not set, an AttributeError exception must
    be raised with the text:
        Attribute not found

    If the attribute has been accessed times, then all subsequent accesses
    must raise a MaxCallsException exception with the text:
        The number of times the attribute can be accessed has been exceeded

    When setting or changing the attribute value, the descriptor must set or
    change this value without any additional checks.

NOTE:
    Additional data validation is not required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of the LimitedTakes
    class, it can be arbitrary.
