# NonKeyword Class Keyword-Restricting Descriptor

## Description üìù

The `NonKeyword` class is a descriptor that manages an attribute, ensuring its value is not a Python keyword string.
It accepts a `name` argument during instantiation, representing the attribute name.
When accessing the attribute, it returns the stored value or raises `AttributeError` with "Attribute not found" if unset.
When setting the attribute, it checks if the value is a Python keyword string, raising `ValueError` with "Invalid value" if it is, otherwise storing the value.

## Purpose üéØ

Designed for scenarios requiring restricted attribute values, such as configuration objects, domain-specific models, or validation in frameworks, where Python keywords must be avoided to prevent naming conflicts or semantic issues.
It‚Äôs also suitable for educational examples demonstrating Python‚Äôs descriptor protocol and keyword validation.
