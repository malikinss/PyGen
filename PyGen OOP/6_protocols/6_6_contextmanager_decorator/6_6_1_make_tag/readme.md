# make_tag Context Manager Tag Printer

## Description 📝

The `make_tag` context manager, implemented using the `@contextmanager` decorator, accepts a single string argument `tag`.
It prints `tag` when entering a `with` block and again when exiting, wrapping the block’s execution with identical tag outputs.
The context manager yields control to the block, adhering to the context manager protocol.

## Purpose 🎯

Designed for scenarios requiring simple bracketing of code execution with markers, such as logging context boundaries, debugging block entry/exit, or formatting output in scripts.
Its lightweight design makes it suitable for quick annotations or educational examples of Python’s context manager protocol using `contextlib`.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Definition**:
    -   Decorated with `@contextmanager` to transform a generator function into a context manager.
    -   Takes `tag` (string) as input.
-   **Operation**:
    -   Prints `tag` before yielding (entry action).
    -   Yields `None` to transfer control to the `with` block.
    -   Prints `tag` after yielding (exit action).
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Outputs `tag` exactly twice per `with` block: once before and once after execution.
    -   Handles exceptions by propagating them, as no suppression is specified.

## Verification ✅

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Basic Usage**: `with make_tag("START"): pass` outputs:
    ```
    START
    START
    ```
-   **With Code**: `with make_tag("GO"): print("inside")` outputs:
    ```
    GO
    inside
    GO
    ```
-   **Protocol**: Correctly implements context manager protocol via `@contextmanager`, yielding once.
-   **Edge Cases**: Empty blocks or any valid `tag` string work as expected.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Correctness**: Simple print-yield-print structure ensures exact tag output timing.
-   **Performance**: Minimal overhead with two print operations.
-   **Design**: `@contextmanager` simplifies implementation, aligning with task’s arbitrary protocol allowance.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
with make_tag("BEGIN"):
    print("Action")  # Outputs: BEGIN\nAction\nBEGIN
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `make_tag` implementation is concise and accurate, printing the specified tag at the start and end of a `with` block.
It’s ideal for marking context boundaries or protocol education, fully compliant with the task’s requirements.
