# safe_write Context Manager Transactional File Writer

## Description üìù

The `safe_write` context manager, implemented using the `@contextmanager` decorator, accepts a `filename` string and enables safe writing to the specified file.
It yields a file-like object for writing within a `with` block.
If an exception occurs during writing, it absorbs the exception, reverts the file to its original state by discarding changes, and prints a message: `An exception <exception type> was raised while writing to the file`.
The context manager ensures atomic writes using a temporary file, preserving the original file‚Äôs state on failure.

## Purpose üéØ

Designed for scenarios requiring robust file modifications, such as updating configuration files, logging, or saving data, where partial writes due to errors must be avoided.
Its ability to revert changes and report errors makes it suitable for reliable file operations in scripting, data pipelines, or educational examples of Python‚Äôs context manager protocol and atomic file handling.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Definition**:
    -   Decorated with `@contextmanager` to create a context manager from a generator.
    -   Takes `filename` (string) as input.
-   **Operation**:
    -   Creates a temporary file name by appending `.tmp` to `filename`.
    -   Opens the temporary file in write mode with UTF-8 encoding, yielding it as `buffer` for writing.
    -   If no exception occurs, replaces the original file with the temporary file using `os.replace`.
    -   If an exception occurs:
    -   Catches it with `except Exception as e`.
    -   Prints `An exception {type(e).__name__} was raised while writing to the file`.
    -   In a `finally` block, removes the temporary file if it exists, ensuring cleanup.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Writes are performed to a temporary file, preserving the original until success.
    -   On exception, the temporary file is discarded, and the original file remains unchanged.
    -   Exception type is reported, and the exception is suppressed.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Successful Write**:
    -   `with safe_write("test.txt") as f: f.write("data")` creates/updates `test.txt` with "data".
-   **Exception Handling**:
    -   `with safe_write("test.txt") as f: f.write("data"); raise ValueError`:
    -   Outputs: `An exception ValueError was raised while writing to the file`.
    -   Leaves `test.txt` unchanged (or empty if it didn‚Äôt exist).
    -   Temporary file is removed.
-   **Atomicity**: Partial writes are never applied to `filename`; only complete writes succeed.
-   **Protocol**: Yields a file object, adhering to context manager protocol via `@contextmanager`.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**: Temporary file approach ensures atomicity; `os.replace` is atomic on most systems. Exception message uses `type(e).__name__` for accurate reporting.
-   **Performance**: File operations (`open`, `write`, `replace`, `remove`) are standard I/O, efficient for typical use.
-   **Design**: Temporary file with `.tmp` suffix and `finally` cleanup is robust, aligning with arbitrary protocol implementation. UTF-8 encoding ensures text compatibility.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Successful write
with safe_write("output.txt") as f:
    f.write("Hello")  # output.txt contains "Hello"

# Failed write
with safe_write("output.txt") as f:
    f.write("Fail")
    raise ValueError  # Prints: An exception ValueError was raised while writing to the file
# output.txt retains "Hello"
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `safe_write` implementation is robust, ensuring atomic file writes with proper exception handling and reversion.
It‚Äôs ideal for reliable file updates or protocol education, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
