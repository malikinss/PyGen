# reversed_print Context Manager Output Reverser

## Description 📝

The `reversed_print` context manager, implemented using the `@contextmanager` decorator, takes no arguments.
It modifies `sys.stdout.write` within a `with` block to reverse the order of characters in any text written to standard output, restoring the original `write` method upon exit.
The context manager yields control to the block, adhering to the context manager protocol.

## Purpose 🎯

Designed for scenarios requiring temporary transformation of console output, such as creating stylized logs, debugging with reversed text for visual distinction, or experimenting with output formatting in scripts.
Its simplicity makes it suitable for quick modifications or educational examples of Python’s context manager protocol and `sys.stdout` manipulation.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Definition**:
    -   Decorated with `@contextmanager` to convert a generator function into a context manager.
    -   Takes no arguments.
-   **Operation**:
    -   Defines `new_write`, a function that takes a `text` string, reverses it with `text[::-1]`, and passes it to the original `sys.stdout.write` (`old_write`).
    -   Saves the original `sys.stdout.write` in `old_write`.
    -   Replaces `sys.stdout.write` with `new_write` to intercept output.
    -   Yields control to the `with` block using `try`.
    -   Restores `sys.stdout.write` to `old_write` in a `finally` block, ensuring cleanup even if exceptions occur.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Reverses character order of all `print` or `sys.stdout.write` outputs within the block.
    -   Restores normal output behavior after the block.

## Verification ✅

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Reversed Output**: `with reversed_print(): print("hello")` outputs `olleh`.
-   **Restoration**: After the block, `print("hello")` outputs `hello`.
-   **Protocol**: Correctly implements context manager protocol via `@contextmanager`, yielding once.
-   **Edge Cases**: Empty blocks, empty strings, or special characters are handled correctly via string reversal.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Correctness**: `text[::-1]` ensures complete character reversal; `try-finally` guarantees restoration.
-   **Performance**: String reversal is O(n) per write, negligible for typical console output.
-   **Design**: `new_write` is minimal, focusing solely on reversal, aligning with task’s simplicity.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
with reversed_print():
    print("hello world")  # Outputs: dlrow olleh
print("normal")  # Outputs: normal
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `reversed_print` implementation is accurate and efficient, reversing `sys.stdout` output within a `with` block and restoring it afterward.
It’s ideal for output transformation tasks or protocol education, fully compliant with the task’s requirements.
