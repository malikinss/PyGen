1. 6_6_1_make_tag

```
# make_tag Context Manager Tag Printer

## Description üìù

The `make_tag` context manager, implemented using the `@contextmanager` decorator, accepts a single string argument `tag`.
It prints `tag` when entering a `with` block and again when exiting, wrapping the block‚Äôs execution with identical tag outputs.
The context manager yields control to the block, adhering to the context manager protocol.

## Purpose üéØ

Designed for scenarios requiring simple bracketing of code execution with markers, such as logging context boundaries, debugging block entry/exit, or formatting output in scripts.
Its lightweight design makes it suitable for quick annotations or educational examples of Python‚Äôs context manager protocol using `contextlib`.
