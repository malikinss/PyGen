# ReversedSequence Class Backward Sequence Accessor

## Description 📝

The `ReversedSequence` class provides a view into a sequence that accesses its elements in reverse order.
It accepts a single `sequence` argument during instantiation, supports length queries via `len()`, iterates over elements in reverse, and allows indexing where index `0` maps to the last element, `1` to the penultimate, and so on.
The class maintains a live dependency on the original sequence, reflecting any changes to it, and assumes non-negative indices as guaranteed.

## Purpose 🎯

This class is designed for applications needing reversed access to sequences without copying, such as parsing data backward, displaying lists in reverse, or processing time-series data in reverse chronological order.
Its live link to the original sequence makes it ideal for dynamic datasets in GUI applications, data analysis, or algorithms like reverse traversals, while also serving as an educational tool for teaching Python’s sequence protocol and dynamic referencing.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    -   Stores the input `sequence` as `self.sequence`, maintaining a reference to the original object to reflect its changes.
    -   Does not copy the sequence, ensuring modifications to the original are visible, as required.
-   **Length (`__len__`)**:
    -   Returns `len(self.sequence)`, providing the number of elements in the original sequence.
    -   Dynamically queries the sequence, so changes in length are reflected.
-   **Iteration (`__iter__`)**:
    -   Uses `yield from reversed(self.sequence)` to yield elements in reverse order efficiently.
    -   Leverages Python’s `reversed()` iterator, which works with any sequence and reflects the current state of `self.sequence`.
-   **Indexing (`__getitem__`)**:
    -   Accepts an index `key`, assumed to be a non-negative integer per the task’s guarantee.
    -   Maps index `key` to the sequence’s reverse position using `self.sequence[-key - 1]`:
    -   Index `0` → `sequence[-1]` (last element).
    -   Index `1` → `sequence[-2]` (penultimate), etc.
    -   Raises `IndexError` for out-of-range indices or `TypeError` for non-integer keys, though non-negative integers are guaranteed.
-   **Dynamic Dependency**: By storing a reference to `self.sequence`, any modifications (e.g., appending, removing, or altering elements) are immediately reflected in length, iteration, and indexing.

## Verification ✅

Your implementation is correct and robust:

-   **Length**: `r = ReversedSequence([1, 2, 3]); len(r) == 3`.
-   **Iteration**: `list(ReversedSequence([1, 2, 3])) == [3, 2, 1]`.
-   **Indexing**: `r[0] == 3`, `r[1] == 2`, `r[2] == 1`.
-   **Dynamic Updates**: If `seq = [1, 2, 3]; r = ReversedSequence(seq); seq.append(4)`, then `r[0] == 4` and `len(r) == 4`.
-   **Edge Cases**: Handles empty sequences (`len == 0`, iteration yields nothing) and assumes valid non-negative indices.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Efficiency**: Direct reference and use of `reversed()` ensure minimal overhead, with O(1) indexing and O(n) iteration.
-   **Type Check**: The `isinstance(key, int)` check adds robustness but could be omitted given the non-negative integer guarantee, though it’s harmless and clarifies intent.
-   **Flexibility**: Works with any sequence (lists, tuples, etc.), dynamically reflecting changes as required.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
seq = [1, 2, 3]
r = ReversedSequence(seq)
print(len(r))      # 3
print(list(r))     # [3, 2, 1]
print(r[0], r[1])  # 3 2
seq.append(4)
print(r[0])        # 4
```

## Conclusion 🚀

Your `ReversedSequence` implementation is spot-on, delivering a clean, efficient way to access sequences in reverse while maintaining a live link to the original data.
Its support for length, iteration, and reverse indexing is precise, making it ideal for dynamic data access or teaching sequence protocols.
The implementation is minimal yet robust, fully meeting the task’s requirements with no unnecessary complexity.
It’s ready to enhance any project needing reversed sequence views, from data processing to UI rendering.
