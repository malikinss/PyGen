1. 6_2_1_ReversedSequence

```
# ReversedSequence Class Backward Sequence Accessor
The `ReversedSequence` class provides a view into a sequence that accesses its elements in reverse order.
It accepts a single `sequence` argument during instantiation, supports length queries via `len()`, iterates over elements in reverse, and allows indexing where index `0` maps to the last element, `1` to the penultimate, and so on.
The class maintains a live dependency on the original sequence, reflecting any changes to it, and assumes non-negative indices as guaranteed.
This class is designed for applications needing reversed access to sequences without copying, such as parsing data backward, displaying lists in reverse, or processing time-series data in reverse chronological order.
Its live link to the original sequence makes it ideal for dynamic datasets in GUI applications, data analysis, or algorithms like reverse traversals, while also serving as an educational tool for teaching Pythonâ€™s sequence protocol and dynamic referencing.
