# SequenceZip Class Tuple Combiner

## Description üìù

The `SequenceZip` class creates a sequence of tuples by combining elements from multiple input sequences, akin to Python‚Äôs `zip()` function.
It accepts arbitrary positional arguments (sequences) during instantiation, stores independent copies, and supports length queries via `len()`, iteration over zipped tuples, and indexing to access tuples by position.
The class ensures independence from the original sequences, uses only non-negative indices as guaranteed, and provides a memory-efficient way to access combined elements.

## Purpose üéØ

This class is designed for tasks requiring synchronized access to multiple sequences, such as merging datasets, processing parallel lists (e.g., names and scores), or generating paired outputs in data processing, machine learning, or reporting.
Its independence and sequence-like interface make it ideal for static snapshots of zipped data, while also serving as an educational tool for teaching Python‚Äôs sequence protocol and zipping mechanics.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    -   Accepts variable positional arguments (`*args`), each a sequence.
    -   Converts each sequence to a tuple (`tuple(seq)`) and stores them in `self._sequences`, ensuring independence from the original sequences (changes to inputs don‚Äôt affect the instance).
    -   Uses tuples for immutability and consistency, as sequences are not modified.
-   **Length (`__len__`)**:
    -   Returns the length of the shortest sequence using `min(len(seq) for seq in self._sequences, default=0)`.
    -   Mimics `zip()` behavior, where the result length is that of the shortest input.
    -   Handles no sequences with `default=0`, returning 0.
-   **Iteration (`__iter__`)**:
    -   Uses `yield from zip(*self._sequences)` to yield tuples, each containing one element from each sequence at corresponding positions.
    -   Leverages Python‚Äôs `zip()` for efficient iteration, stopping at the shortest sequence.
-   **Indexing (`__getitem__`)**:
    -   Takes a non-negative integer `key` (guaranteed valid).
    -   Returns a tuple `(seq[key] for seq in self._sequences)`, combining the `key`-th element from each sequence.
    -   Raises `IndexError` if `key` exceeds the shortest sequence length, consistent with sequence behavior.
-   **Independence**: Storing tuples ensures the instance remains unchanged if original sequences are modified, meeting the task‚Äôs requirement.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Your implementation is correct and efficient:

-   **Initialization**: `sz = SequenceZip([1, 2], [3, 4])` stores `[(1, 2), (3, 4)]`.
-   **Length**: `len(sz) == 2`; `SequenceZip([]) == 0`.
-   **Iteration**: `list(SequenceZip([1, 2], [3, 4])) == [(1, 3), (2, 4)]`.
-   **Indexing**: `sz[0] == (1, 3)`, `sz[1] == (2, 4)`.
-   **Independence**: If `lst = [1, 2]; sz = SequenceZip(lst); lst[0] = 0`, then `sz[0] == (1, ...)`.
-   **Edge Cases**: Handles empty sequences, no arguments, or unequal lengths correctly.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Efficiency**: Storing tuples is O(n) in space for all elements, but iteration and indexing are O(1) per access. No redundant copying occurs.
-   **Edge Cases**: Non-negative indices and valid data are guaranteed, so no extra checks are needed.
-   **Memory**: Converting to tuples ensures independence but uses memory proportional to input size, which is reasonable for the task.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
sz = SequenceZip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
print(len(sz))      # 3
print(list(sz))     # [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
print(sz[1])        # (2, 5)
lst = [1, 2]
sz2 = SequenceZip(lst)
lst[0] = 0
print(sz2[0])       # (1, ...)
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

Your `SequenceZip` implementation is spot-on, delivering a clean, efficient sequence of zipped tuples with support for length, iteration, and indexing.
Its use of tuples ensures independence from input changes, while the design mimics `zip()` elegantly.
Perfect for data pairing or teaching sequence protocols, it fully meets the task‚Äôs requirements with no unnecessary complexity.
Ready to streamline any project needing synchronized sequence access!
