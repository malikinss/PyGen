# print_file_content Function File Display Utility
The `print_file_content` function accepts a `filename` parameter, a string representing a text file’s name (including extension).
It prints the file’s contents using UTF-8 encoding.
If the file is absent from the program’s folder, it outputs "File not found".
Designed for basic file reading tasks, such as displaying logs, configurations, or text data in scripts or command-line tools.
Error handling ensures clear feedback for missing files, fitting automation, debugging, or educational file I/O demonstrations.
