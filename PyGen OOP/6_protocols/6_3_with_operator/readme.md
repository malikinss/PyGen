```
# print_file_content Function File Display Utility
The `print_file_content` function accepts a `filename` parameter, a string representing a text file’s name (including extension).
It prints the file’s contents using UTF-8 encoding.
If the file is absent from the program’s folder, it outputs "File not found".
Designed for basic file reading tasks, such as displaying logs, configurations, or text data in scripts or command-line tools.
Error handling ensures clear feedback for missing files, fitting automation, debugging, or educational file I/O demonstrations.
```

2. 6_3_2_non_closed_files

```
# non_closed_files Function Open File Filter
The `non_closed_files` function accepts a list of file objects (`files`) and returns a new list containing only the open file objects, preserving their original order from the input list.
Designed for scenarios requiring identification of active file handles, such as resource management, debugging file leaks, or cleanup in applications handling multiple files.
It ensures only open files are processed, useful in scripting or system administration tasks.
