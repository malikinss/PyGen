```
# Point Class 3D Coordinate Handler
The `Point` class models a point in 3D space, defined by `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates provided during instantiation.
It offers a formal string representation as `Point(x, y, z)` and implements iterability, allowing the coordinates to be accessed sequentially as an iterable object yielding `x`, `y`, and `z` in that order.
This provides a lightweight and intuitive way to represent and interact with spatial points.
This class is designed for geometric computations, visualization, or simulations requiring 3D points, such as in computer graphics, physics engines, or data analysis.
Its iterable nature makes it convenient for unpacking coordinates or looping through them, while the formal representation aids debugging and logging.
It’s also an excellent educational tool for teaching Python’s special methods, particularly `__repr__` and `__iter__`, in the context of object-oriented programming.
