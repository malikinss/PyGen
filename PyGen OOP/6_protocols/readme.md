1. 6_1_iterable_objects_and_iterators_protocol

```
# Lesson 6.1: Iterable Objects and Iterators Protocol 🔄
This lesson covers:
-   Iterables and iterators in Python
-   Iterables protocol with the **`__iter__()`**8 magic method
-   Iterators protocol with the **`__next__()`** magic method
-   Practical implementation of custom iterables and iterators
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 7 programming practical tasks, and 12 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the difference between iterables and iterators
✅ Implement custom iterables using **`__iter__()`**
✅ Create iterators with **`__next__()`** for controlled element access
✅ Apply iteration protocols to diverse scenarios like 3D points and random looping
```

2. 6_2_sequence_protocol

```
# Lesson 6.2: Sequence Protocol 📋
This lesson covers:
-   Magic method **`__len__()`** for sequence length
-   Magic methods **`__getitem__()`**, **`__setitem__()`**, and **`__delitem__()`** for indexing
-   Magic method **`__contains__()`** for membership testing
-   Practical implementation of the sequence protocol
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 9 programming practical tasks, and 8 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to implement sequence behavior using magic methods
✅ Create custom sequences with indexing, length, and membership operations
✅ Apply the sequence protocol to diverse scenarios like sparse arrays and mutable strings
✅ Build sequence-like objects that integrate with Python’s ecosystem
```

3. 6_3_with_operator

```
# Lesson 6.3: With Operator 🔒
This lesson covers:
-   Resource management in Python
-   The `with` operator for context management
-   Practical implementation of file handling with context managers
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 3 programming practical tasks, and 11 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand resource management using the `with` operator
✅ Implement context managers for safe file handling
✅ Apply the `with` operator to manage resources in practical scenarios
✅ Recognize the benefits of automatic resource cleanup
```

4. 6_4_context_manager_protocol_part_1

```
# Lesson 6.4: Context Manager Protocol (Part 1) 🔐
This lesson covers:
-   The context manager protocol in Python
-   Magic methods **`__enter__()`** and **`__exit__()`**
-   Exception handling inside `with` blocks
-   Examples of built-in context managers
-   Examples of creating custom context managers
This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, 1 programming practical task, and 22 theoretical questions available on the Stepik platform.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the context manager protocol and its components
✅ Implement custom context managers using **`__enter__()`** and **`__exit__()`**
✅ Handle exceptions within `with` blocks effectively
✅ Apply context managers to manage resources in practical scenarios
