TODO:
    Implement the Closer class.

    When instantiated, the class must accept one argument:
        obj â€” an arbitrary object

    The Closer class instance must be a context manager that closes the used
    obj object using the close() method after executing the code inside
    the with block.

    If the object does not support the close operation, the context manager
    must print:
    Unclosed object

NOTE:
    Visual examples of using the Closer class are demonstrated in the test
    data.

    Additional data validation is not required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    The Closer class must satisfy the context manager protocol, that is,
    have __enter__() and __exit__() methods.

    The protocol implementation can be arbitrary.
