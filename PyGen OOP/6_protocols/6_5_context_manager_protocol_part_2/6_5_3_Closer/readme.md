# Closer Class Resource Cleanup Manager

## Description üìù

The `Closer` class is a context manager that takes an arbitrary object `obj` during instantiation.
It implements the context manager protocol with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
Upon exiting a `with` block, it attempts to call `obj.close()`.
If the object lacks a `close` method, it prints "Unclosed object".
The class ensures proper resource cleanup for objects supporting `close`, such as file handles or sockets.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for managing resources that require explicit closure, such as files, database connections, or network sockets, in a `with` block.
It provides a unified way to ensure cleanup while handling non-closable objects gracefully, suitable for resource-heavy applications, scripting, or educational demonstrations of Python‚Äôs context manager protocol.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    -   Accepts `obj` (any object) and stores it as `self.obj`.
-   **Enter Method (`__enter__`)**:
    -   Returns `self.obj`, allowing the original object to be used within the `with` block.
-   **Exit Method (`__exit__`)**:
    -   Accepts `*args` (exception details: `exc_type`, `exc_value`, `traceback`) and `**kwargs` for protocol compliance.
    -   Attempts to call `self.obj.close()` to close the object.
    -   Catches `AttributeError` (raised if `close` is missing) and prints "Unclosed object".
    -   Returns `None` implicitly, allowing exceptions to propagate if they occur during `close`.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Closes objects with a `close` method (e.g., files) after the block.
    -   Prints a message for objects without `close` (e.g., strings, integers).
    -   Preserves block execution and exception handling.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation meets requirements:

-   **Closable Object**: For a file object (`open('test.txt')`), `with Closer(f): pass` calls `f.close()` after the block.
-   **Non-Closable Object**: For a string (`"text"`), `with Closer("text"): pass` prints:
    ```
    Unclosed object
    ```
-   **Protocol**: `__enter__` returns the object; `__exit__` handles closure or prints appropriately.
-   **Edge Cases**: Handles objects with/without `close`, empty blocks, and exceptions correctly.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**: `try-except` for `AttributeError` precisely targets missing `close` methods, avoiding overcatching.
-   **Performance**: Minimal overhead with a single method call or exception check.
-   **Design**: Returning `obj` in `__enter__` enables direct use, aligning with typical context manager patterns.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
with Closer(open('test.txt', 'w')) as f:
    f.write('data')  # File is closed after block

with Closer("not closable"):
    print("Inside")  # Prints: Inside\nUnclosed object
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `Closer` implementation is accurate and efficient, correctly managing resource cleanup for closable objects and handling non-closable ones with the specified message.
It‚Äôs ready for resource management tasks or protocol education, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
