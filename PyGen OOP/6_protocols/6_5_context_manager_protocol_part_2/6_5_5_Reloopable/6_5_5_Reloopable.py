TODO:
    Implement the Reloopable class.

    When instantiated, the class must accept one argument:
        file â€” a file object open for reading

    An instance of the Reloopable class must be a context manager that allows
    iterating over the file object inside the with block.

    The context manager must also close the file object it uses after
    executing the code inside the with block.

NOTE:
    Visual examples of using the Reloopable class are demonstrated in the test
    data.

    Additional data validation is not required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    The Reloopable class must satisfy the context manager protocol, that is,
    have the __enter__() and __exit__() methods.

    The protocol implementation can be arbitrary.
