TODO:
    Implement the Suppress class.

    When instantiated, the class must accept an arbitrary number of positional
    arguments, each representing an exception type.

    An instance of the Suppress class must be a context manager that
    suppresses an exception if it is raised during the execution of the code
    inside the with block.

    The exception types that are suppressed must be those that were listed
    when the context manager was created.

    An instance of the Suppress class must also have one attribute:
        exception â€” the exception that was suppressed by the context manager.

    If the exception was not suppressed or the code was executed without
    exceptions, the attribute must be None

NOTE:
    Visual examples of using the Suppress class are demonstrated in the test
    data.

    No additional data validation is required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    The Suppress class must conform to the context manager protocol, that is,
    it must have __enter__() and __exit__() methods.

    The implementation of the protocol can be arbitrary.
