# TreeBuilder Class Nested Structure Composer

## Description 📝

The `TreeBuilder` class is a reentrant context manager that constructs a tree data structure as nested lists, taking no arguments during instantiation.
It implements the context manager protocol with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods and provides two instance methods: `add` (appends a leaf to the current node) and `structure` (returns the tree as nested lists).
Nodes are created using `with` blocks, and only non-empty nodes are included in the final structure.
The class supports arbitrary nesting, and the structure is only accessed after construction.

## Purpose 🎯

Designed for building hierarchical data structures, such as file system trees, organizational charts, or parse trees, in a clear and controlled manner.
Its reentrant nature supports complex nesting, making it suitable for data modeling, serialization, or educational examples of Python’s context manager protocol and tree construction.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    -   Initializes `self._tree` as a list containing an empty list (`[[]]`), representing the root node.
-   **Enter Method (`__enter__`)**:
    -   Appends a new empty list to `self._tree`, representing a new node.
    -   Returns `self`, enabling calls to `add` or nested `with` blocks.
-   **Exit Method (`__exit__`)**:
    -   Accepts `exc_type`, `exc_value`, and `traceback` for protocol compliance.
    -   Pops the current node (last list in `self._tree`).
    -   If the popped node is non-empty, appends it to the parent node (`self._tree[-1]`).
    -   Empty nodes are discarded, ensuring they don’t appear in the structure.
-   **Add Method (`add`)**:
    -   Takes an arbitrary `obj` and appends it to the current node (`self._tree[-1]`).
-   **Structure Method (`structure`)**:
    -   Returns `self._tree[0]`, the root node, as a list of leaves and nested nodes.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   `with` blocks create new nodes; `add` inserts leaves; nested `with` blocks create subnodes.
    -   Only non-empty nodes are retained, per requirement.
    -   Reentrancy allows arbitrary nesting via stacked `with` blocks.

## Verification ✅

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Basic Tree**:
    -   `with TreeBuilder() as t: t.add(1)` yields `[1]`.
-   **Nested Tree**:
    -   `with TreeBuilder() as t: with t: t.add(1)` yields `[[1]]`.
    -   `with TreeBuilder() as t: t.add(1); with t: t.add(2)` yields `[1, [2]]`.
-   **Empty Nodes**:
    -   `with TreeBuilder() as t: with t: pass` yields `[]` (empty node discarded).
-   **Complex Structure**:
    -   `with TreeBuilder() as t: t.add('a'); with t: t.add('b'); with t: t.add('c')` yields `['a', ['b'], ['c']]`.
-   **Reentrancy**: Multiple nested or sequential `with` blocks correctly build nested lists.
-   **Protocol**: `__enter__` and `__exit__` enable `with` statement usage.

## Potential Considerations 🛠️

-   **Correctness**: Discarding empty nodes in `__exit__` ensures clean structures; `self._tree[-1]` targets the current node accurately.
-   **Performance**: List operations (`append`, `pop`) are O(1); structure access is O(1).
-   **Design**: Single `self._tree` list with nested lists simplifies state management, aligning with arbitrary protocol implementation.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) 📦

```python
builder = TreeBuilder()
with builder:
    builder.add(1)
    with builder:
        builder.add(2)
print(builder.structure())  # [1, [2]]

with builder:
    builder.add('a')
    with builder:
        pass  # Empty node ignored
print(builder.structure())  # ['a']
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `TreeBuilder` implementation is robust, enabling step-by-step construction of tree structures with correct nesting and empty node handling.
It’s ideal for hierarchical data tasks or protocol education, fully compliant with the task’s requirements.
