# UpperPrint Class Uppercase Output Transformer

## Description üìù

The `UpperPrint` class is a context manager that takes no arguments during instantiation.
It modifies `sys.stdout.write` within a `with` block to convert all text output to uppercase, restoring the original `write` method upon exit.
The class implements the context manager protocol with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, ensuring seamless integration with standard output operations.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for scenarios requiring temporary modification of console output, such as formatting logs, debugging with emphasized text, or creating stylized command-line interfaces.
It‚Äôs also valuable for educational purposes, demonstrating Python‚Äôs context manager protocol and manipulation of `sys.stdout`.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    -   Takes no arguments.
    -   Initializes `self.original_write` as `None` to store the original `sys.stdout.write` method.
-   **Uppercase Write Method (`_upper_write`)**:
    -   Accepts `text` (string to write), `*args`, and `**kwargs` for compatibility with `write` calls.
    -   Converts `text` to uppercase using `str(text).upper()`.
    -   Calls `self.original_write` with the uppercased text and any additional arguments.
-   **Enter Method (`__enter__`)**:
    -   Saves `sys.stdout.write` in `self.original_write`.
    -   Replaces `sys.stdout.write` with `self._upper_write` to intercept output.
    -   Returns `None`, as the context manager modifies output behavior rather than providing a usable object.
-   **Exit Method (`__exit__`)**:
    -   Accepts `*args` (exception details) and `**kwargs` for protocol compliance.
    -   Restores `sys.stdout.write` to `self.original_write`, reverting output behavior.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   All `print` or `sys.stdout.write` calls within the `with` block output in uppercase.
    -   Original output behavior is restored after the block, even if exceptions occur.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Uppercase Output**: `with UpperPrint(): print("hello")` outputs `HELLO`.
-   **Restoration**: After the block, `print("hello")` outputs `hello`.
-   **Protocol**: `__enter__` and `__exit__` enable `with` statement usage.
-   **Edge Cases**: Handles empty blocks, non-string outputs (via `str()`), and exceptions without disrupting restoration.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**: `str(text).upper()` ensures all input is converted, and restoration is guaranteed in `__exit__`.
-   **Performance**: Minimal overhead with direct method replacement and string conversion.
-   **Design**: `_upper_write` preserves `write` method flexibility, and `None` return in `__enter__` aligns with the task‚Äôs focus on output modification.

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
with UpperPrint():
    print("hello world")  # Outputs: HELLO WORLD
print("normal")  # Outputs: normal
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `UpperPrint` implementation is precise, effectively transforming `sys.stdout` output to uppercase within a `with` block and restoring it afterward.
It‚Äôs suitable for output formatting or protocol education, fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.
