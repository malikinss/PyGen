TODO:
    Implement the ReadableTextFile class.

    When creating an instance, the class must accept one argument:
        filename â€” the name of the text file

    An instance of the ReadableTextFile class must be a context manager
    that opens a file named filename for reading in UTF-8 encoding and allows
    you to get its lines without the line break character \n at the end.

    The context manager must also close the file it opened after executing
    the code inside the with block.

NOTE:
    Visual examples of using the ReadableTextFile class are demonstrated in
    the test data.

    Additional data validation is not required.

    It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

    The ReadableTextFile class must satisfy the context manager protocol,
    that is, have the __enter__() and __exit__() methods.

    The protocol implementation can be arbitrary.
