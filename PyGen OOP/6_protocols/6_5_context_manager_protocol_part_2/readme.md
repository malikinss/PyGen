1. 6_5_1_SuppressAll

```
# SuppressAll Class Exception Silencer (Revised)
The `SuppressAll` class implements a context manager that suppresses all exceptions raised within its `with` block.
It accepts no arguments during instantiation and fulfills the context manager protocol through `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
Exceptions occurring in the block are caught and suppressed, allowing execution to proceed uninterrupted.
Intended for scenarios where exceptions can be safely ignored, such as non-critical operations, fallback mechanisms, or testing setups expecting failures.
It streamlines error handling in scripts and serves as a clear example for learning Pythonâ€™s context manager protocol.
