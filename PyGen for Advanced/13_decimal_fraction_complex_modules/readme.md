# Chapter 13: Decimal Module, Fraction Module, and Complex Data Type 📚

## Description 📝

In this chapter, I explore three key Python features: the `decimal` module, the `fractions` module, and the `complex` data type. These features are essential for handling precise arithmetic and working with rational numbers and complex numbers in Python.

## Sections in this Chapter 📂

### 13_1: Decimal Module 🔢

In this section, I dive into the `decimal` module, which provides support for fast and precise decimal arithmetic. The `Decimal` class is particularly helpful when dealing with financial and scientific applications that require high precision.

### 13_2: Fraction Module ⚖️

Here, I explore Python’s `fractions` module, which allows for precise operations with rational numbers. I will learn how to convert decimals to fractions, perform arithmetic on fractions, and work with series of rational numbers.

### 13_3: Complex Data Type 🧑‍🔬

In this section, I will work with Python's `complex` data type to handle complex numbers (numbers with real and imaginary parts). I will learn how to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers, calculate their absolute value, and work with complex expressions.
