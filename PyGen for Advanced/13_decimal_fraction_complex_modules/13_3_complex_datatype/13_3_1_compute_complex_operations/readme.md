# Complex Number Operations

## Description 📝

This Python program takes two complex numbers as input and calculates their sum, difference, and product.
The complex numbers are inputted in standard form (e.g., `1+2j` or `3-4j`), and the program performs basic arithmetic operations on them.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers in Python.
The program calculates and displays the sum, difference, and product of two complex numbers.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The user is prompted to input two complex numbers.
    - The input should follow the format `a+bj`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `j` represents the imaginary unit.
2. **Processing**:
    - The program reads the complex numbers using Python’s built-in `complex()` function.
    - It computes the sum, difference, and product of the two complex numbers.
3. **Output**:
    - The program prints the results of the sum, difference, and product of the two complex numbers.

## Output 📜

The program outputs the sum, difference, and product of the two complex numbers in the following format:

### Example:

For the input:

```

Enter a complex number (e.g., 1+2j): 1+2j
Enter a complex number (e.g., 1+2j): 3+4j

```

The output will be:

```

(1+2j) + (3+4j) = (4+6j)
(1+2j) - (3+4j) = (-2-2j)
(1+2j) \* (3+4j) = (-5+10j)

```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `complex_operations.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python complex_operations.py`
5. Enter two complex numbers when prompted, and the results will be displayed.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides an easy way to perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers using Python’s built-in capabilities.
It is a great demonstration of how Python handles complex numbers and can be useful in applications that require such calculations. 🎯
