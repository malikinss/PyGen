# Lesson 13.3: Complex Data Type (complex) üßë‚Äçüî¨

## Description üìù

This lesson introduces complex numbers and the Python `complex` data type.
Complex numbers consist of a real and an imaginary part, and the lesson explores the arithmetic operations, absolute value, and other features associated with complex numbers.

We also dive into the `cmath` module and how it simplifies calculations involving complex numbers.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to provide an understanding of how to work with complex numbers in Python.
By the end of the lesson, I will know how to:

-   Perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
-   Work with the `abs()` function to find the absolute value of a complex number.
-   Calculate complex expressions involving powers and conjugates of complex numbers.

## Tasks üìú

### 1. 13_3_1 Complex Number Operations ‚ûó

This Python program takes two complex numbers as input and calculates their sum, difference, and product. The complex numbers are inputted in standard form (e.g., `1+2j` or `3-4j`), and the program performs basic arithmetic operations on them.
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers in Python. It calculates and displays the sum, difference, and product of two complex numbers.

### 2. 13_3_2 Find Complex Number with Maximum Absolute Value üîç

This Python program receives a list of complex numbers and calculates the complex number with the largest absolute value. The program then prints the complex number and its absolute value.
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to find and print the complex number with the largest absolute value from a list of complex numbers. The absolute value is calculated using Python's built-in `abs()` function.

### 3. 13_3_3 Complex Expression Calculation ‚ûó

This Python program calculates the value of the expression involving two complex numbers and their conjugates. Given a natural number `n` and two complex numbers `z1` and `z2`, the program computes:

```

z1^n + z2^n + conj(z1)^n + conj(z2)^(n+1)

```

Where `conj(z)` is the complex conjugate of `z`.
The purpose of this program is to compute and output the result of a mathematical expression involving powers and conjugates of complex numbers.
The program uses Python's built-in capabilities for complex number arithmetic, including the conjugate and exponentiation operations.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing this lesson, I will:

-   Understand how to handle complex numbers in Python.
-   Be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication on complex numbers.
-   Learn to find the complex number with the largest absolute value.
-   Gain experience working with complex expressions, including conjugates and exponentiation.
