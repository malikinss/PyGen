### 2. 13_1_2 Get Largest Numbers 📊

This script processes a string of space-separated decimal numbers, calculates their sum, and identifies the five largest numbers in descending order. The results are displayed on two lines:

-   The total sum.
-   The five largest numbers.

This task demonstrates how to:

1. Convert a string of decimal numbers into `Decimal` objects.
2. Calculate the total sum of numbers in a list.
3. Extract and sort the five largest numbers.
