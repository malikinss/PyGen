# Sum of Minimum and Maximum Decimal Numbers

## Description 📝

This Python script calculates the sum of the smallest and largest decimal numbers from a string of space-separated decimal values.
It demonstrates the use of Python's `Decimal` class for precise decimal arithmetic and basic list operations like finding minimum and maximum values.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to showcase how to:

1. Parse a string of decimal numbers into a list of `Decimal` objects.
2. Use Python's built-in functions (`min()` and `max()`) to find the smallest and largest values in a list.
3. Perform arithmetic operations with `Decimal` objects for accurate calculations.

This exercise is useful for understanding string manipulation, list operations, and working with the `Decimal` class in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input String**: The program starts with a string of decimal numbers separated by spaces.
2. **String to List Conversion**: The string is split into individual elements, which are then converted into a list of `Decimal` objects.
3. **Finding Min and Max**: The `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the smallest and largest values in the list.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The smallest and largest values are added together to produce the final result.
5. **Output**: The result is printed to the console.

## Output 📜

When the script is executed, it prints the sum of the smallest and largest decimal numbers in the input string. For example:

```
9.97 + 0.03 = 10.00
```

The output will be:

```
10.00
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code to a file named `sum_min_max_decimal.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python sum_min_max_decimal.py
    ```
5. The program will calculate and print the sum of the smallest and largest decimal numbers in the predefined string.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a practical example of working with decimal numbers in Python, emphasizing precision and basic list operations.
It reinforces concepts like string parsing, list manipulation, and arithmetic operations with the `Decimal` class. Happy coding! 😊
