# Fraction Operations

## Description 📝

This Python program takes two fractions as input in the format `a/b` and performs four arithmetic operations on them: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are displayed as simplified fractions.

## Purpose 🎯

The program allows you to input two fractions and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient, displaying the results in their simplest form.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - Two fractions in string format (`a/b`).
2. **Processing**:
    - The program uses the `fractions.Fraction` class to perform arithmetic operations on the fractions.
3. **Output**:
    - The program outputs the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two fractions as simplified fractions.

## Output 📜

The program prints the results of the arithmetic operations.

### Example:

For the input:

```
fraction_1 = "2/3"
fraction_2 = "4/5"
```

The output will be:

```
2/3 + 4/5 = 22/15
2/3 - 4/5 = -2/15
2/3 * 4/5 = 8/15
2/3 / 4/5 = 5/6
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `fraction_operations.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python fraction_operations.py`
5. Enter two fractions when prompted, and the results will be displayed.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program simplifies working with fractions by automatically reducing them to their lowest terms and performing arithmetic operations efficiently. 🎯
