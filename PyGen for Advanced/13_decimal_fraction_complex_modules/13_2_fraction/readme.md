# Lesson 13.2: Working with Fractions in Python ‚öñÔ∏è

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I explore Python‚Äôs `fractions` module and the `Fraction` data type, which allows me to work with rational numbers (fractions) in a precise and easy way.
The `Fraction` class enables operations such as simplification, addition, subtraction, and multiplication on fractions.

## Tasks üìú

### 1. 13_2_1 Decimal to Fraction Converter üîÑ

This Python program takes a list of decimal numbers (represented as strings) and converts them to their equivalent fractional representations. The fractions are then simplified and displayed.

This task demonstrates how to use Python's `fractions.Fraction` class to convert decimal numbers to fractions and simplify them for easier readability.

---

### 2. 13_2_2 Sum of Max and Min as Fraction ‚ûï

This Python program processes a string of decimal numbers separated by spaces. It finds the maximum and minimum values, calculates their sum, and returns the result as a simplified fraction.

The task demonstrates how to find the max and min values in a list of decimals and compute their sum as a simplified fraction using Python‚Äôs `fractions.Fraction` class.

---

### 3. 13_2_3 Reduce Fraction ‚ûó

This Python program reduces a given fraction `m/n` to its simplest form by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and simplifying the fraction using Python‚Äôs `fractions.Fraction` class.

This task demonstrates how to simplify a fraction by reducing it to its lowest terms using the GCD.

---

### 4. 13_2_4 Fraction Operations ‚ûó‚ûï

This Python program takes two fractions as input and performs four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are displayed as simplified fractions.

This task demonstrates how to perform common arithmetic operations on fractions and display the results in their simplest form.

---

### 5. 13_2_5 Sum of Rational Numbers Series Œ£

This program calculates the sum of a series of rational numbers of the form:

\[
1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + \ldots + 1/(n^2)
\]

The result is displayed as a simplified fraction.

The task demonstrates how to compute the sum of a rational series involving squared terms and output the result in fractional form.

---

### 6. 13_2_6 Sum of Rational Numbers Involving Factorials Œ£!

This program calculates the sum of a series of rational numbers of the form:

\[
1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + \ldots + 1/n!
\]

The result is displayed as a simplified fraction.

The task demonstrates how to compute the sum of a series involving factorials and output the result as a rational number in its simplest form.

---

### 7. 13_2_7 Largest Proper Irreducible Fraction ‚ûï

This Python program finds the largest proper irreducible fraction where the sum of the numerator and denominator equals a given natural number \( n \). The fraction must be proper (numerator < denominator) and irreducible.

The task calculates the largest proper irreducible fraction where the sum of the numerator and denominator equals \( n \) and outputs it in the form "numerator/denominator".

---

### 8. 13_2_8 Get Irreducible Fractions Between 0 and 1 üßÆ

This Python program calculates all irreducible fractions between 0 and 1 where the denominator does not exceed a given natural number \( n \). The fractions are output in ascending order.

The task demonstrates how to find all irreducible fractions between 0 and 1 with denominators less than or equal to \( n \) and print them in ascending order.

---

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing this lesson, I will:

-   Understand how to use Python's `fractions.Fraction` class for accurate and simplified fraction operations.
-   Be able to perform basic arithmetic, reduce fractions, and work with series of rational numbers.
-   Gain insight into the concept of irreducible fractions and how to generate them programmatically.

These tasks showcase the versatility of the `fractions` module for handling rational numbers efficiently and effectively in Python.
