# Fraction Reduction

## Description 📝

This Python program reduces a given fraction `m / n` to its simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator using Python's built-in `fractions.Fraction` class.

## Purpose 🎯

The program simplifies a fraction by reducing it to its lowest terms and prints the result as a simplified fraction.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - Two natural numbers `m` (numerator) and `n` (denominator).
2. **Processing**:
    - The program uses the `Fraction` class to automatically reduce the fraction to its simplest form.
3. **Output**:
    - The program outputs the simplified fraction in the form of `numerator/denominator`.

## Output 📜

The program will print the reduced fraction.

### Example:

For the input:

```
m = 8
n = 12
```

The output will be:

```
4/6
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `reduce_fraction.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python reduce_fraction.py`
5. The result will be printed to the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to simplify fractions by reducing them to their lowest terms. The `fractions.Fraction` class handles the underlying calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) automatically, making the code efficient and simple to use. 🎯
