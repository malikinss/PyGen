# Lesson 2.1: Revisiting Basic Python Constructs 🔄

## Description 📝

Welcome back to the continuation course "Advanced Python Programming"!
In this lesson, I will revisit the fundamental constructs of Python that we learned previously.
These topics are crucial as I continue my journey into more advanced programming techniques.
I’ll go through problems on various subjects including input/output, data types, conditional statements, loops, strings, lists, and functions.

This lesson will help me refresh my knowledge while solving a range of problems from simple to more complex ones.
Remember, programming is a journey!

## Purpose 🎯

-   **Review Core Concepts**: Revisit essential Python constructs to solidify your understanding.
-   **Solve Practical Problems**: Apply Python constructs to solve real-world tasks and problems.
-   **Develop Algorithmic Thinking**: Improve your ability to think logically and algorithmically to solve more complex problems.

## How It Works 🔍

I’ll go through a set of problems where I will need to implement Python’s basic constructs like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions to solve practical problems.
By the end of this lesson, I will have a stronger understanding of these basic constructs and how to apply them to real-world tasks.

## Tasks 📜

### 2_1_1 Arithmetic Operations Program ➕➖✖️➗

This Python script performs a series of arithmetic operations on two integers provided by the user.
The operations include sum, difference, product, quotient, integer division, remainder, and the square root of the sum of their 10th powers.

### 2_1_2 Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator ⚖️

This Python program calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height, and classifies it into one of three categories: underweight, optimal weight, or overweight.
The BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

### 2_1_3 String Cost Calculator 💰

This Python program calculates the cost of a given string, where each character (including spaces) costs 50 cents.
The program computes the total cost and presents it in dollars and cents, helping to estimate text-based pricing.

### 2_1_4 Word Count Program 📚

This Python program counts the number of words in a given string.
It accounts for multiple spaces between words, making it ideal for text analysis tasks.

### 2_1_5 Chinese Zodiac Program 🐉

This program reads a given year and determines the associated animal from the Chinese zodiac.
The Chinese zodiac follows a 12-year cycle, and each year corresponds to a different animal.

### 2_1_6 Reverse Last Five Digits Program 🔄

This Python program takes a five-digit or six-digit natural number as input and reverses the order of its last five digits.
This transformation can be useful for coding challenges or cryptographic purposes.

### 2_1_7 Format Number with Commas Program 💰

This program takes a natural number as input and formats it by inserting commas at appropriate places according to the standard American convention. It improves the readability of large numbers, particularly useful for financial figures or population data.

### 2_1_8 Josephus Problem Program 🔄

This program solves the Josephus problem, where `n` people stand in a circle and every `k`-th person is eliminated in each round until only one person remains.
The program calculates the position of the last remaining person in the circle.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `2_1_basic_constructions` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 2_1_1_calculate_operations.py
    python 2_1_2_classify_bmi.py
    python 2_1_3_calculate_string_cost.py
    python 2_1_4_count_words_in_string.py
    python 2_1_5_get_chinese_zodiac.py
    python 2_1_6_reverse_last_five_digits.py
    python 2_1_7_format_number_with_commas.py
    python 2_1_8_find_last_person.py
    ```
4. Input values as prompted in the terminal to solve each task.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, I will have refreshed my knowledge of Python's core constructs while solving a variety of practical problems.
The tasks in this lesson are designed to test and strengthen my understanding of the essential building blocks of Python.
I'll keep practicing, and I’ll be ready to move on to more advanced topics! 🚀✨
