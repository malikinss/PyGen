# Lesson 2.2: Revisiting Basic Python Constructs üîÑ

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I explore various basic Python constructs.
The focus is on practical programs that cover common operations such as counting, swapping, shifting elements, string processing, and more.
Each task in this lesson emphasizes fundamental programming techniques that are widely applicable in real-world scenarios.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on coding challenges.
I'll work with loops, conditional statements, list manipulations, and string operations, all while strengthening my problem-solving skills.

## Tasks üìú

### 2_2_1 - Count Points in Quadrants

This program counts the number of points that fall into each quadrant on a coordinate plane. Points on the axes are ignored.

-   **Key Concept**: Coordinate plane, conditionals.

### 2_2_2 - Count Numbers Greater Than Previous

This program checks how many numbers in a sequence are greater than the one preceding them.

-   **Key Concept**: Iteration, comparisons.

### 2_2_3 - Swap Adjacent Elements

This program swaps adjacent elements in a list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last one stays in place.

-   **Key Concept**: List manipulation, swapping elements.

### 2_2_4 - Cyclic Right Shift

This program shifts the elements of a list one position to the right cyclically, with the last element moving to the first position.

-   **Key Concept**: List rotation, cyclic shifts.

### 2_2_5 - Count Unique Elements

This program counts how many unique elements are present in a sorted list of numbers.

-   **Key Concept**: Set operations, list traversal.

### 2_2_6 - Is Product in Set

This program checks if a given number is the product of two distinct numbers from a set.

-   **Key Concept**: Set operations, multiplication, conditionals.

### 2_2_7 - Determine Winner (Rock, Paper, Scissors)

This program simulates the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, determining the winner based on the players' choices.

-   **Key Concept**: Conditional logic, user input handling.

### 2_2_8 - Determine Winner (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock)

This program extends the classic game to include more options, offering a more complex decision-making process.

-   **Key Concept**: Extended conditional logic, game logic.

### 2_2_9 - Count Max Consecutive Heads

This program counts the longest sequence of consecutive heads ("H") in a string representing coin toss results.

-   **Key Concept**: String manipulation, sequence counting.

### 2_2_10 - Find Infected Refrigerators

This program checks which refrigerators are infected by searching for the sequence "anton" in each line of status data.

-   **Key Concept**: String searching, iteration.

### 2_2_11 - Process String (Russian Alphabet)

This program processes a string by sequentially removing each letter of the Russian alphabet, printing the string at each step.

-   **Key Concept**: String manipulation, alphabet traversal.

## How It Works üîç

Each task implements a basic Python construct, such as iteration, conditional checks, list operations, or string manipulations.
I will be required to process inputs, apply logic, and output results in an efficient and clear manner.

## Usage üì¶

1. Clone the repository containing the tasks.
2. Open each task's Python file.
3. Read the task description and understand the required input and output.
4. Implement the solution using the appropriate Python constructs.
5. Run the program with sample inputs to verify my solution.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing the tasks in this lesson, I‚Äôll solidify my understanding of Python's core features and gain practical experience in handling common programming challenges.
This will serve as a foundation for more complex problems and advanced Python concepts.
