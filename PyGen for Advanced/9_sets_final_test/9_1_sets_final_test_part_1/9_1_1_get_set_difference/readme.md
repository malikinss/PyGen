# Set Difference Example Program

## Description 📝

This program defines a function that calculates the difference between two sets.
It returns the elements present in the first set but not in the second set.
The specific task was to modify the contents of `set1` to ensure that the difference between `set1` and `set2` results in `{'p'}`.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to compute the difference between two sets in Python, using basic set operations.
The program specifically shows how to manipulate sets to achieve a desired output by adjusting their contents.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function**: The `get_set_difference()` function takes two sets as input arguments.
2. **Set Difference**: It calculates and returns the difference between the two sets using the `-` operator.
3. **Example Input**:
    - `set1 = {'p'}`
    - `set2 = {'a', 't', 'f'}`
4. **Output**: The program will output the set containing only `'p'` from `set1` because `'p'` is not present in `set2`.

## Output 📜

The program outputs:

```
{'p'}
```

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `set_difference.py`).
2. Run the script. It will automatically print the result after calculating the difference between the sets.
3. Modify the `set1` and `set2` variables if you want to experiment with different inputs.

## Conclusion 🚀

This small program serves as a simple demonstration of set operations in Python, specifically the set difference operation, and can be extended to more complex set-related problems.
