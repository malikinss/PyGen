# Lesson 9.1: Sets Final Test (Part 1) 🔧

## Description 📝

This lesson contains 15 theoretical questions on sets, as well as one practical task.
The theoretical questions are available on the course page on the Stepik online platform, accessible via this link:  
[Stepik Course - Sets Final Test (Part 1)](https://stepik.org/lesson/479453/step/1?unit=470428).

In this lesson, I will apply my knowledge of set operations to solve a practical problem.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to test my understanding of set operations, specifically set differences.
I'll also gain hands-on experience with Python's set operations.

## Key Concepts 📚

This lesson focuses on the concept of set differences, which allows you to find elements that are in one set but not in another.
The set difference operation is useful for tasks where you need to compare two sets and identify exclusive elements in the first set.

## Example Program 💻

### 9_1_1_get_set_difference

```
This program defines a function that calculates the difference between two sets.
It returns the elements present in the first set but not in the second set.
The specific task was to modify the contents of `set1` to ensure that the difference between `set1` and `set2` results in `{'p'}`.
```

## Conclusion 🚀

By mastering set operations like difference, you can efficiently compare data sets and extract useful information.
This lesson will help solidify my understanding of how sets work and their applications in Python.
