# Lesson 9.2: Sets Final Test (Part 2) üîß

## Description üìù

This lesson consists of 11 practical tasks that test my knowledge and skills of working with sets in Python.
These tasks cover a variety of real-world scenarios where sets are used to solve problems efficiently.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to evaluate my understanding of set operations in Python by providing a series of challenges that simulate real-life problems requiring set manipulation.

## Tasks üìù

### 9_2_1_calculate_homework_completed

This program helps a teacher determine how many students in a class have completed their homework, considering various reasons for not submitting it. Students may have missed homework due to:

-   Their homework being eaten by a dog.
-   A power outage at their home.
-   Both of the above misfortunes.
    The program calculates the number of students who successfully submitted their homework based on the provided inputs.
    To efficiently calculate the number of students who completed their homework by accounting for overlapping reasons that caused homework submission issues.

### 9_2_2_calculate_repeated_readings

The Voskhod satellite transmits solar radiation energy readings every minute to the observatory. To analyze these readings effectively, repeated data must be removed. This program calculates the maximum number of repeated readings in the dataset, helping scientists prepare clean and unique data for further analysis.
To determine how many redundant readings (repeated data) can be eliminated from the transmitted satellite data, ensuring accurate solar activity analysis.

### 9_2_3_check_city_repetition

Timur and Ruslan love playing a game of naming cities. However, by the end of the game, they sometimes forget which cities they've already mentioned. This program helps them keep track by checking if a new city has already been named, ensuring they don‚Äôt repeat themselves.
To assist Timur and Ruslan in identifying if a newly named city during their game has already been mentioned, ensuring the game runs smoothly and without confusion.

### 9_2_4_check_books_in_library

At the end of the school year, Ruslan received a summer reading list from his school. To prepare, he needs to determine which books from the list are already available in his home library. This program helps Ruslan check each book in his reading list against his library collection.
To help Ruslan (or anyone with a similar task) determine which books from a required list are present in their library and which are missing.

### 9_2_5_find_common_numbers

Timur, a mathematician with a love for solving puzzles, tackles two challenging math problems daily. He writes down all the numbers from each problem and then checks for any common numbers between the two. If common numbers are found, the day is considered a success. If no common numbers exist, Timur concludes it was a "BAD DAY."
This program helps Timur automate the process by finding and displaying the common numbers between the two problems or reporting that no common numbers exist.
To identify and display the common numbers between two math problems solved by Timur or indicate the absence of common numbers.

### 9_2_6_check_memory_test

The BEEGEEK online school director assesses new candidates' memory skills alongside their professional qualities. Candidates are briefly shown a set of numbers and are later required to recall them without omitting or adding any numbers. The order does not matter, but the accuracy does. This program evaluates whether the candidate successfully passed the memory test by comparing the given numbers with the numbers recalled by the candidate.
To determine if a candidate has accurately recalled all the numbers shown during the memory test without any omissions or additions.

### 9_2_7_count_only_math_students

At BEEGEEK online school, students study either math, computer science, or both. The principal has a list of students studying each subject, and the task is to determine how many students study **only math**. The problem ensures there are no students with the same last name, simplifying the identification of students.
The program helps the school principal determine the number of students who are studying **only math** by comparing the two sets of students ‚Äî one for math and the other for computer science (informatics).

### 9_2_8_count_students_studying_one_subject

At BEEGEEK online school, each student studies either math, computer science (informatics), or both. The school principal has lists of students enrolled in each subject. This program helps the principal find out how many students study only one of the subjects.
To determine how many students study only one subject (either math or informatics) and not both.

### 9_2_9_get_union_of_students

The head and the assistant of the online school BEEGEEK each have a list of students they remember. This program finds and outputs the names of all the students that both the head and the assistant remember.
To identify all unique students remembered by either the head or the assistant and output their names in sorted order.

### 9_2_10_get_unique_students

The program helps the principal of BEEGEEK online school determine how many students are studying only one subject, either math or computer science (informatics), or both. The program takes two lists of students‚Äîone for math and one for informatics‚Äîand calculates how many students study exclusively one subject.
The program calculates the number of students studying only one subject and outputs the result. If there are no such students, it outputs "NO."

### 9_2_11_get_students_attending_all_lessons

This program helps the head of BEEGEEK online school determine which students attended all lessons from the beginning of the school year. For each lesson, a list of students who attended is provided, and the program calculates the students who attended every lesson.
The program calculates and outputs the names of students who attended all lessons. It takes the number of lessons and their respective student attendance lists, then determines the students present in every lesson.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing this final test, I will reinforce my understanding of set operations and their applications in real-world scenarios, such as data analysis, memory tests, and student management.
