TODO:
    The Voskhod satellite has a device for measuring solar activity.

    Every minute it transmits a positive integer to the observatory via
    a communication channel â€” the amount of solar radiation energy.

    To correctly analyze the results, there is no need to keep repeating data,
    so they must be deleted.

    Write a program that outputs the maximum number of satellite readings,
    deleting which will correctly analyze the result.
