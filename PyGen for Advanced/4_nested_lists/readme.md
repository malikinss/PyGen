# Section 4: Nested Lists and Matrices üßë‚Äçüíª

In this section, I'll dive into nested lists and matrices in Python, learning how to manipulate complex data structures.
These concepts are fundamental for dealing with multi-dimensional data, such as matrices, which are common in fields like data science, linear algebra, and computer graphics.
I'll explore practical tasks that will enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of Python's data structures.

## Description üìù

This section contains seven lessons, each focusing on different aspects of nested lists and matrices:

-   **4_1_repeating_lists**: A warm-up quiz to review my understanding of list operations and concepts.

-   **4_3_nested_lists_part_2**: Advanced operations with nested lists, such as generating Pascal‚Äôs Triangle and working with sublists.
-   **4_4_matrices_part_1**: Basic matrix operations, including transposition and working with diagonals.
-   **4_5_matrices_part_2**: Intermediate matrix manipulations, including column swapping, symmetry checking, and rotating matrices.
-   **4_6_matrices_part_3**: Advanced matrix operations and constructing matrix patterns like checkerboards and diagonals.
-   **4_7_matrix_operations**: Fundamental matrix operations, including addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
