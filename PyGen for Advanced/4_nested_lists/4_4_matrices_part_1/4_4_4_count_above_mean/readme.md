# Square Matrix Elements Above Mean Program üìù

## Description üìù

This program calculates the number of elements in each row of a square matrix that are greater than the arithmetic mean of the elements of that row.
The program reads the matrix from user input, computes the required count for each row, and prints the results.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to find how many elements in each row of a square matrix exceed the arithmetic mean of that row.
This type of analysis is useful in matrix manipulation and can be applied to statistical data or matrix-based problems.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Input**:

    - The program first reads an integer `n`, which represents the size of the square matrix (i.e., the number of rows and columns).
    - The following `n` lines contain `n` space-separated integers, representing the rows of the matrix.

2. **Row Analysis**:

    - For each row, the arithmetic mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the row elements by the number of elements in the row.
    - It then counts how many elements in the row are greater than this mean.

3. **Output**:
    - The program prints the count of elements greater than the arithmetic mean for each row, one per line.

### Example:

**Input:**

```plaintext
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
1
1
```

**Explanation:**

-   For the first row [1, 2, 3], the mean is (1+2+3)/3 = 2. The only element greater than the mean is 3, so the count is 1.
-   For the second row [4, 5, 6], the mean is (4+5+6)/3 = 5. The only element greater than the mean is 6, so the count is 1.
-   For the third row [7, 8, 9], the mean is (7+8+9)/3 = 8. The only element greater than the mean is 9, so the count is 1.

## Usage üì¶

1. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `matrix_mean_above.py`).
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python matrix_mean_above.py
    ```
3. Enter the size of the matrix (`n`) followed by the elements of the matrix.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program helps in analyzing matrix rows and identifying how many elements are greater than the arithmetic mean of the row.
It showcases basic matrix manipulation, arithmetic mean calculation, and list comprehensions in Python.
