# Nested Lists Part 1 (Lesson 4_2) 📋

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on nested lists in Python, which are lists that contain other lists as elements.
I will learn how to manipulate nested lists using various list methods such as `append()`, `extend()`, and others.
The lesson also covers essential built-in functions like `len()`, `max()`, and `min()` for working with nested lists.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to help me:

-   Understand the concept of nested lists in Python.
-   Learn how to modify nested lists using methods like `append()` and `extend()`.
-   Practice finding maximum values in nested lists and reversing their elements.
-   Calculate averages across nested lists.

## Key Topics 🔍

-   **Nested Lists**: Lists within lists, how to access and manipulate them.
-   **`append()` and `extend()` Methods**: Techniques for adding elements to nested lists.
-   **`max()` Function**: Finding the largest element within nested lists.
-   **Reversing Lists**: Using the `reverse()` method to reverse each sublist.
-   **Calculating Averages**: Summing and averaging elements in nested lists.

## Lessons Overview 🎯

### 4_2_1 Append

In this lesson, I'll learn how to use the `append()` method to add a value to the innermost sublist in a nested list.

### 4_2_2 Extend

Learn how to use the `extend()` method to add multiple elements to an innermost sublist.

### 4_2_3 Find Maximum in Nested Lists

Find the largest element among all elements in a list of nested lists using the `max()` function.

### 4_2_4 Reverse Nested Lists

Reverse each individual sublist within a nested list using the `reverse()` method.

### 4_2_5 Calculate Average

Learn how to calculate the average of all numbers across all sublists in a nested list.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **`append()` Method**: Adds an element to the end of a list. This is useful when you want to modify the innermost list in a nested list.
2. **`extend()` Method**: Adds multiple elements to a list, which is useful for adding more items to a nested list.
3. **`max()` Function**: Finds the maximum value from the sublists by comparing the maximum values of individual lists.
4. **`reverse()` Method**: Reverses the order of elements in each sublist.
5. **Average Calculation**: Iterate over each sublist, sum the elements, and divide by the total number of elements to compute the average.

## Output 📜

Each task will have a specific result, such as:

-   An updated nested list after `append()` or `extend()`.
-   The largest element in the nested lists.
-   The reversed version of each sublist.
-   The calculated average value.

## Usage 📦

1. Review the program descriptions and understand what each method does.
2. Test the provided code by running it in your Python environment.
3. Modify and extend the code to experiment with other nested list operations.
4. Try solving each task and check if the output matches the expected results.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, I will have a solid understanding of how to manipulate nested lists using various methods and functions in Python.
These techniques will be essential for working with more complex data structures.
I'll keep practicing and experimenting with different operations on nested lists to strengthen my skills!
