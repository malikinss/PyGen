# Matrix Pattern Program 🧮

## Description 📝

This program generates an `n x n` matrix with a specific pattern. The matrix is filled with `1`s and `0`s, forming a diamond-like structure of `1`s in the middle, surrounded by `0`s.

### Example:

For the input:

```
n = 5
```

The resulting matrix will be:

```
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to create an `n x n` matrix where the elements follow a diamond-like pattern of `1`s surrounded by `0`s. This demonstrates how to manipulate matrix elements in a structured way.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes an input `n` (the size of the matrix).
2. It generates the matrix, where:
    - The center of the matrix has `1`s forming a diamond shape.
    - The outer part of the matrix consists of `0`s.
3. The matrix is printed row by row, with each number separated by spaces.

## Output 📜

The program prints the generated matrix where `1`s form a pattern and `0`s fill the rest.

### Example:

For input `n = 5`, the output will be:

```
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Input the value of `n` (size of the matrix).
3. View the resulting matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the creation of a matrix with a unique pattern of `1`s and `0`s, centered in a diamond-like formation. It provides an interesting example of matrix manipulation and pattern generation.
