# Matrix Number Filler 📊

## Description 📝

This program takes two natural numbers `n` and `m` as input and creates a matrix of size `n x m`. The matrix is filled with consecutive numbers starting from `1` and continuing row by row, as shown in the example below:

For example, when `n = 3` and `m = 4`, the program will output:

```
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to generate a matrix filled with consecutive numbers, making it a useful exercise in matrix creation and iteration.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user inputs two integers `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
2. The program creates the matrix row by row, filling it with consecutive numbers starting from `1`.
3. The matrix is printed row by row with each element separated by a space.

## Output 📜

The program prints the matrix with consecutive numbers in the specified size, row by row.

### Example:

```
Input:
3 4

Output:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the dimensions of the matrix (`n` for rows, `m` for columns).
3. View the resulting matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the creation and printing of a matrix filled with consecutive numbers, offering an easy way to practice handling matrices in programming.
