# Checkerboard Matrix Generator ♟️

## Description 📝

This program generates a matrix of size `n x m` and fills it with a checkerboard pattern using the symbols `.` and `*`.
The upper-left corner of the matrix will always be a dot (`.`), and the matrix will alternate between dots and asterisks (`*`), similar to a chessboard pattern.

## Purpose 🎯

The program creates and displays a matrix with alternating dots and asterisks, where:

-   The matrix size is specified by the user.
-   The upper-left corner is always a dot.
-   The program outputs the matrix with each element separated by spaces.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user inputs two natural numbers `n` and `m`, representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
2. The matrix is filled with alternating symbols `.` and `*`, starting with a `.` in the upper-left corner.
3. The program then displays the matrix with each element separated by a space.

## Output 📜

The program prints the generated matrix in a checkerboard pattern.

### Example:

```
Input:
4 5

Output:
. * . * .
* . * . *
. * . * .
* . * . *
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the dimensions of the matrix (rows and columns).
3. View the resulting checkerboard matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program generates a visually appealing checkerboard matrix, useful for practicing matrix generation and pattern creation in programming.
