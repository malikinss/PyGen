# Diagonal Pattern Matrix Program 🔢

## Description 📝

This program generates an `n x m` matrix filled with numbers in a diagonal pattern. Starting from the top-left corner, it fills the matrix diagonally, with each diagonal containing numbers in increasing order.

### Example:

For the input:

```
n = 3
m = 5
```

The resulting matrix will be:

```
1  2  4  7  10
3  5  8  11 13
6  9  12 14 15
```

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to generate a matrix filled with numbers following a diagonal pattern. This can be useful for tasks involving matrix traversal, number filling patterns, or algorithms requiring this type of arrangement.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes input values for `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns).
2. It initializes an empty matrix of size `n x m`, filled with zeros.
3. The matrix is filled diagonally. For each diagonal, it places numbers starting from the top-left corner and continues along the diagonal.
4. After filling all diagonals, the program prints the matrix row by row.

## Output 📜

The program prints the generated matrix filled with numbers in a diagonal pattern, as shown in the example above.

### Example:

For input `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the output will be:

```
1  2  4  7  10
3  5  8  11 13
6  9  12 14 15
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Input the values for `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns).
3. View the resulting matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to fill a matrix following a diagonal pattern. It can be applied to different use cases where a matrix needs to be populated in a specific order, such as in algorithms or pattern generation tasks.
