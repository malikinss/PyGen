# Matrix Filler 🧮

## Description 📝

This program generates a matrix of size `n x m` and fills it with consecutive numbers from 1 to `n * m`, arranged according to a specific pattern. The matrix is displayed after filling.

## Purpose 🎯

The program allows the user to input two natural numbers `n` and `m`, representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix. It then fills the matrix with numbers from 1 to `n * m` in a pattern where each row starts from the next number in sequence and is filled consecutively.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
2. The matrix is generated row by row, with each row containing consecutive numbers starting from 1 up to `n * m`.
3. The matrix is printed, with elements separated by spaces.

## Output 📜

The program prints the generated matrix according to the given pattern.

### Example:

```
Input:
3 4

Output:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the size of the matrix `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
3. View the resulting matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program efficiently fills a matrix with numbers in a structured and clear pattern, demonstrating how to manage matrix creation and filling in Python.
