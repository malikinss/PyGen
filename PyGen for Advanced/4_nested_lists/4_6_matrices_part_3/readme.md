# Matrices Part 3 (Lesson 4_6) 📊

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I dive deeper into working with matrices, focusing on creating and manipulating rectangular and square matrices.
The lesson covers key topics such as:

-   Methods `ljust()` and `rjust()`.
-   Working with main and secondary diagonals.
-   Constructing different matrix patterns (checkerboard, diagonal, and more).

## Purpose 🎯

This lesson aims to:

-   Strengthen my understanding of matrix creation and manipulation.
-   Teach techniques for filling matrices with specific patterns.
-   Explore how to work with diagonals in both square and rectangular matrices.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson consists of a series of programs that demonstrate different ways to manipulate and generate matrices:

1. **Checkerboard Matrix Generator**: Creates a matrix with alternating `.` and `*` symbols in a checkerboard pattern.
2. **Side Diagonal Matrix Generator**: Generates a square matrix with `1`s on the side diagonal, `0`s above, and `2`s below.
3. **Matrix Number Filler**: Fills a matrix of size `n x m` with consecutive numbers.
4. **Matrix Pattern Generator**: Generates matrices with various patterns such as diamonds, snakes, and shifted numbers.

## Tasks Overview 📜

1. **4_6_1_create_checkerboard_matrix**: Generates a matrix with a checkerboard pattern using `.` and `*`.
2. **4_6_2_create_matrix_with_side_diagonal**: Creates a matrix with `1`s on the side diagonal and fills other elements with `0`s and `2`s.
3. **4_6_3_get_matrix_n_X_m**: Fills an `n x m` matrix with consecutive numbers.
4. **4_6_4_get_matrix_n_X_m**: Generates a matrix of size `n x m` and fills it with numbers from 1 to `n * m`.
5. **4_6_5_get_matrix**: Creates an `n x m` matrix filled with numbers in a row-by-row sequential pattern.
6. **4_6_6_get_matrix**: Generates a matrix with a diamond-like pattern of `1`s surrounded by `0`s.
7. **4_6_7_get_matrix**: Generates a matrix filled with cyclically shifted rows.
8. **4_6_8_get_matrix**: Fills an `n x m` matrix in a snake-like pattern.
9. **4_6_9_fill_diagonal_matrix**: Fills a matrix following a diagonal pattern, with increasing numbers in each diagonal.
10. **4_6_10_get_matrix**: Generates a matrix with a diagonal pattern that starts from the first row or column and moves downwards.

## Usage 📦

1. Review each program to understand its functionality.
2. Experiment with the programs by modifying matrix sizes or patterns.
3. Apply matrix manipulation methods such as `ljust()` and `rjust()` to align the matrix content in a readable manner.
4. Test the generated matrices with different inputs to observe various patterns and behavior.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson equips me with the tools to generate and manipulate matrices with different patterns and structures.
By understanding how to work with diagonals, rows, and specific patterns, I'll have a stronger foundation for handling matrices in Python.
