# Matrix Filler Program 🧮

## Description 📝

This program generates an `n x m` matrix where the elements are filled with numbers starting from `1` up to `n * m`. The matrix is filled row by row.

### Example:

For the input:

```
n = 3
m = 4
```

The resulting matrix will be:

```
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

## Purpose 🎯

The program generates a matrix of size `n x m` with elements filled sequentially from `1` to `n * m`. It is designed to practice matrix manipulation and the use of loops.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes two natural numbers `n` (rows) and `m` (columns) as input.
2. It creates an empty matrix of size `n x m` and fills it with numbers from `1` to `n * m` in a row-wise pattern.
3. The matrix is then printed row by row, with each number separated by spaces.

## Output 📜

The program prints the generated matrix where the elements are filled from `1` to `n * m` in a row-wise manner.

### Example:

For input `n = 3` and `m = 4`, the output will be:

```
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Input the values for `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns).
3. View the resulting matrix printed on the screen.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to generate and display a matrix with a specified size, filled sequentially with numbers in a row-wise pattern. It's a simple and efficient solution to a common matrix problem.
