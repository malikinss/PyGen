# Nested Lists Part 2 (Lesson 4_3) 📋

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I focus on more advanced operations with nested lists.
I will learn how to create, read, and manipulate nested lists, as well as generate complex structures such as Pascal’s Triangle and grouped characters.
The tasks involve list creation, processing, and extraction of sublists.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to:

-   Learn how to create and manipulate nested lists.
-   Demonstrate how to generate Pascal’s Triangle and other complex data structures.
-   Help me understand how to work with contiguous sublists and pack identical characters.

## Key Topics 🔍

-   **Creating Lists of Lists**: Methods for generating nested lists, including sequences and indexed lists.
-   **Pascal's Triangle**: How to generate specific rows and the full triangle.
-   **Identical Character Packing**: Grouping repeating characters from a string into sublists.
-   **Chunking and Sublists**: Splitting lists into smaller, manageable chunks or generating all contiguous sublists from a given list.

## Lessons Overview 🎯

### 4_3_1 Create Lists

In this lesson, I will generate a list of sublists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

### 4_3_2 Create Nested Lists

This program creates a nested list where each sublist contains a sequence of integers starting from 1, up to the index of that sublist.

### 4_3_3 Pascal's Triangle

Learn how to generate a specific row of Pascal’s Triangle based on a given index `n`.
This triangle contains binomial coefficients, and each number is the sum of the two numbers above it.

### 4_3_4 Pascal's Triangle Generator

In this lesson, I will generate and output the first `n` rows of Pascal’s Triangle, printing each row individually.

### 4_3_5 Pack Identical Characters

This program takes a string as input and groups consecutive identical characters into sublists, making it easy to identify repeating patterns in strings.

### 4_3_6 Chunked

Learn how to chunk a list into smaller sublists of a given size `n`, which is useful for handling large datasets.

### 4_3_7 Generate Sublists

This lesson demonstrates how to generate all contiguous sublists from a list.\
This operation can be useful for pattern matching or extracting subsequences.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **List of Lists Creation**: Generate lists containing sequences of numbers.
2. **Pascal’s Triangle**: Construct specific rows or full triangle using binomial coefficients.
3. **Identical Character Packing**: Group identical consecutive characters into sublists.
4. **Chunking**: Split a list into smaller sublists of specified size.
5. **Generating Contiguous Sublists**: Extract all contiguous sublists from a list.

## Output 📜

The output for each task is:

-   A list of lists or sequences, such as the generated Pascal's Triangle or nested lists.
-   Sublist groupings for identical characters.
-   Chunked sublists of a specified size.
-   Contiguous sublists from a given list.

## Usage 📦

1. Read the program description and understand the purpose of each task.
2. Run the provided code in your Python environment.
3. Modify the code to experiment with different data or input values.
4. Practice creating, manipulating, and processing nested lists in various ways.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will have a strong understanding of how to generate and manipulate nested lists in Python.
I’ll be equipped to create more complex data structures and solve problems involving nested data.
I'll keep practicing to master list manipulations and to better handle real-world data structures.
