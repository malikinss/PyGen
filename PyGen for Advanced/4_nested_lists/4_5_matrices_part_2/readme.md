# Matrices Part 2: Working with Matrices üìê

## Description üìù

This lesson is dedicated to working with matrices, including both square and rectangular matrices.
I'll learn various methods for manipulating matrix elements, such as swapping columns, checking symmetry, rotating the matrix, and working with diagonals.
I'll also explore the methods `ljust()` and `rjust()` for formatting matrix elements.
The lesson includes practical tasks that will help me better understand the different operations that can be performed on matrices.

## Purpose üéØ

The aim of this lesson is to:

-   Understand matrix representation and operations in Python.
-   Practice fundamental matrix manipulations, such as transposing, rotating, and swapping elements.
-   Learn how to check matrix properties like symmetry and magic squares.
-   Improve my problem-solving skills with real-world matrix-related problems.

## Structure of the Tasks üîç

1. **4_5_1 Create Multiplication Table**: Generate a multiplication table of size `n x m`.
2. **4_5_2 Find Maximum Element's Indices**: Find the indices of the maximum element in a matrix.
3. **4_5_3 Swap Columns**: Swap two columns in a given matrix.
4. **4_5_4 Check Symmetry**: Check if a square matrix is symmetric about its main diagonal.
5. **4_5_5 Swap Diagonals**: Swap the main and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.
6. **4_5_6 Mirror Matrix**: Mirror a square matrix along the horizontal axis of symmetry.
7. **4_5_7 Rotate Matrix 90¬∞ Clockwise**: Rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
8. **4_5_8 Mark Knight's Moves**: Simulate a knight's moves on a chessboard.
9. **4_5_9 Is Magic Square**: Check if a matrix is a magic square.

## How It Works üîç

Each task is designed to introduce me to new concepts and methods that are essential when working with matrices in Python.
The problems cover:

-   Basic matrix creation and manipulation.
-   Using matrix indexing to access and modify elements.
-   Applying matrix properties such as symmetry, magic squares, and diagonal manipulation.
-   Formatting the output of matrix-related operations for better readability.
