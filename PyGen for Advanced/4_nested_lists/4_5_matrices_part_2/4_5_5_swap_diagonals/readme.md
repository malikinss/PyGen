# Matrix Diagonal Swap Program 🧮

## Description 📝

This program swaps the elements on the main and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.
Each element remains in the same column, and the elements on both diagonals are swapped.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the manipulation of diagonal elements in a square matrix, specifically swapping the main and secondary diagonals while maintaining the structure of the matrix.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program reads a square matrix from user input.
2. It swaps the elements on the main diagonal with the corresponding elements on the secondary diagonal.
3. The modified matrix is then printed row by row.

## Output 📜

The program will print the updated matrix where the main and secondary diagonal elements are swapped.

## Usage 📦

1. Enter the size of the matrix (n) — the number of rows and columns.
2. Enter the matrix elements row by row, separated by spaces.
3. The program will output the matrix with swapped diagonal elements.

### Example:

```
Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
3 2 1
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program effectively demonstrates matrix manipulation by swapping diagonal elements.
It's a useful exercise in working with two-dimensional arrays and indexing in Python.
