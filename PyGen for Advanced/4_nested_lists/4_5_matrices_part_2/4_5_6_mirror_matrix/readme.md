# Matrix Mirroring Program 🪞

## Description 📝

This program mirrors the elements of a square matrix relative to the horizontal axis of symmetry, effectively swapping the top and bottom halves of the matrix.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to mirror the elements of a square matrix along the horizontal axis of symmetry, which is useful for operations in image processing and matrix manipulations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program first reads the size of the square matrix (n x n).
2. It then reads the matrix elements row by row.
3. The matrix is mirrored by swapping rows from the top half with the rows from the bottom half.
4. Finally, the program prints the mirrored matrix.

## Output 📜

The program will output the matrix after mirroring along the horizontal axis.

## Usage 📦

1. Enter the size of the matrix (n) — the number of rows and columns.
2. Enter the matrix elements row by row, separated by spaces.
3. The program will output the matrix mirrored along the horizontal axis.

### Example:

```
Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple demonstration of mirroring a square matrix along its horizontal axis of symmetry, which is useful for a variety of matrix-based transformations.
