# Matrix Rotation 90° Clockwise Program 🔄

## Description 📝

This program rotates a square matrix of numbers by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction.
Each element of the matrix is shifted to a new position based on the rotation rule.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to rotate a given n x n square matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
This is a common operation in image processing, data visualization, and matrix transformations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program first reads the size of the square matrix (n x n).
2. It then reads the matrix elements row by row.
3. To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise:
    - The elements of the matrix are rearranged such that the first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.
4. The program then prints the rotated matrix.

## Output 📜

The program will output the matrix after it has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

## Usage 📦

1. Enter the size of the matrix (n) — the number of rows and columns.
2. Enter the matrix elements row by row, separated by spaces.
3. The program will output the rotated matrix.

### Example:

```
Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the process of rotating a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise, which can be useful in a variety of mathematical and graphical applications.
