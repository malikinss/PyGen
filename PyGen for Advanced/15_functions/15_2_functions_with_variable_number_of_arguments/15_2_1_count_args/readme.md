# count_args() Function

## Description 📝

The `count_args()` function accepts an arbitrary number of arguments and returns the count of those arguments. This function is useful when you need to determine how many arguments were provided without requiring them to be passed as a list.

## Purpose 🎯

The function simplifies counting inputs by using Python's variable-length argument syntax (`*args`), which collects all positional arguments into a tuple. It then returns the length of that tuple, representing the number of arguments passed.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The function uses `*args` to capture any number of positional arguments.
-   It returns the count of these arguments using the built-in `len()` function.

## Usage 📦

Example calls:

```python
print(count_args())               # Output: 0
print(count_args(1, 2, 3))          # Output: 3
print(count_args("a", True, None))  # Output: 3
print(count_args(5, 10, 15, 20))     # Output: 4
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `count_args()` function is a simple yet powerful utility for determining the number of arguments passed to a function. It leverages Python's flexible argument handling to provide a clean and concise solution for argument counting.
