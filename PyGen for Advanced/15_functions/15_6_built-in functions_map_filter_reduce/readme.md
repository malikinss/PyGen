# Lesson 15.6: Built-in Functions `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on three fundamental built-in functions in Python: **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, and **`reduce()`**, which are commonly used in functional programming. Additionally, it introduces the **`operator` module**, which provides efficient alternatives to using lambda functions.

Key topics covered in this lesson:

-   **`map()`**: Applies a given function to all items in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple).
-   **`filter()`**: Selects elements from an iterable based on a specified condition.
-   **`reduce()`**: Applies a function cumulatively to elements of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.
-   **`operator` module**: Provides pre-built functions that can be used instead of lambda functions for arithmetic, logical, and item access operations.

This lesson **does not include practical tasks** but contains **14 theoretical questions** to test my understanding.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to provide a deep understanding of how built-in functional programming utilities can be used to simplify and optimize data processing tasks.
By mastering `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, along with the `operator` module, I will be able to write more concise and efficient Python code.

## Key Takeaways üîç

-   **`map(function, iterable)`** ‚Üí Transforms elements of an iterable using a function.
-   **`filter(function, iterable)`** ‚Üí Filters elements of an iterable based on a condition.
-   **`reduce(function, iterable)`** ‚Üí Applies a function cumulatively to reduce an iterable to a single value (from `functools` module).
-   **`operator` module** ‚Üí Provides optimized functions for mathematical and logical operations, such as `operator.add`, `operator.mul`, and `operator.itemgetter`.

## Conclusion üöÄ

Understanding `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` is essential for functional programming in Python.
These functions, along with the `operator` module, help write cleaner, more efficient, and readable code.
This lesson provides the theoretical foundation needed to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
