TODO:
    A polynomial of degree n is an expression of the form:
        a(n) * x^n + a(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a(2) * x^2 + a(1) * x + a(0)
    where a(n), a(n-1), ..., a(2), a(1), a(0) are the coefficients of
    the polynomial (a(n) â‰  0).

    The first line of the program input contains the coefficients of
    the polynomial, separated by a space, and an integer x on the second line.

    Write a program that calculates the value of the specified polynomial
    for a given value of x.

NOTE:
    The solution to the problem must be written as a function
    evaluate(coefficients, x), which accepts a list of coefficients and
    an argument value.

    The evaluate() function must be implemented based on the built-in map()
    and reduce() functions.
