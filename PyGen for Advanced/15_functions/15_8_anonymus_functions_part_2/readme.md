# Lesson 15.8: Anonymous Functions (Part 2)

## Description 📝

This lesson is focused on **anonymous functions** (also known as **lambda functions**) in Python.
It covers how to define, pass arguments to, and use them in various operations. Additionally, the lesson explores the use of the **conditional operator** inside anonymous functions and highlights some limitations of these functions.

The lesson demonstrates practical applications of anonymous functions for solving common tasks efficiently.

Key topics:

-   Defining anonymous functions.
-   Using conditional operators inside anonymous functions.
-   Passing arguments to anonymous functions.
-   Understanding the limitations of anonymous functions.

## Purpose 🎯

The main objective of this lesson is to showcase how anonymous functions can be used to write concise and functional code, especially when a function is needed temporarily or for a simple operation.
By learning the use of **`lambda` functions**, I will be able to simplify my code and improve readability in scenarios where creating a full function might not be necessary.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson uses various examples of **lambda functions** for tasks like filtering and sorting data, evaluating polynomials, and checking conditions on numbers and strings.

### Practical Tasks Covered in This Lesson:

1. **15_8_1_func** – Divisibility check using an anonymous function (`lambda`).
2. **15_8_2_func** – Checking if a string starts and ends with 'A' using `lambda`.
3. **15_8_3_is_non_negative_num** – Checking if a string represents a non-negative number.
4. **15_8_4_is_num** – Validating if a string is a valid number using `lambda`.
5. **15_8_5_filter_and_sort** – Filtering and sorting words of exact length 6 using `lambda`.
6. **15_8_6_process_numbers** – Filtering and transforming numbers using `lambda`.
7. **15_8_7_sorted_data** – Sorting US states by the last letter of the state name.
8. **15_8_8_sort_russian_words** – Sorting Russian words by length and lexicographic order.
9. **15_8_9_max_numeric_value** – Finding the largest numeric value in a mixed list.
10. **15_8_10_sort_numbers_before_strings** – Sorting a mixed list of numbers and strings.
11. **15_8_11_get_opposite_color** – Finding the opposite color in RGB using `lambda`.
12. **15_8_12_polynomial** – Evaluating a polynomial using `lambda` and Horner's method.

## Output 📜

The programs in this lesson use **lambda functions** to:

-   Process data in a concise manner.
-   Perform conditional operations.
-   Sort and filter data efficiently.

Examples of outputs:

-   Checking divisibility of a number by 19 or 13.
-   Validating if a string represents a number.
-   Sorting words by length and lexicographic order.

## Conclusion 🚀

Anonymous functions (`lambda`) are a powerful tool for simplifying Python code.
They allow for concise and temporary function definitions, particularly in scenarios where the function is used only once.
By mastering **lambda functions**, I'll be able to write more functional and clean code, improving both performance and readability.
