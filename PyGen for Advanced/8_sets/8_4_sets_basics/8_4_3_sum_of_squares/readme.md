# Sum of Squares Program 🔢

## Description 📝

This program calculates the sum of the squares of the elements in a given set of integers.
The program ensures that duplicate values are removed by utilizing Python’s set, and the square of each unique element is computed and summed.

## Purpose 🎯

-   To compute the sum of squares of unique integers.
-   To demonstrate Python’s ability to efficiently perform mathematical operations using list comprehensions and set data structures.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `sum_of_squares`**:

    - Accepts a set of integers as input.
    - Iterates over each element, calculates its square, and sums the squared values.

2. **Set Initialization**:

    - A set of integers (including duplicates) is initialized.
    - The set automatically filters out duplicates, ensuring each element is squared only once.

3. **Result Calculation**:
    - The sum of the squares of unique elements is computed and printed to the console.

### Example:

```python
numbers = {
    9089, -67, -32, 1, 78,
    23, -65, 99, 9089, 34,
    -32, 0, -67, 1, 11,
    111, 111, 1, 23
}
print(sum_of_squares(numbers))
```

**Output**:

```
16657022
```

## Output 📜

-   The program squares each unique integer in the set and sums the results.
-   For example, if the set is `{1, -67, -32, 78, 23, -65, 99, 34, 0, 11, 111, 9089}`, the calculations would be:
    ```
    1^2 + (-67)^2 + (-32)^2 + 78^2 + 23^2 + (-65)^2 + 99^2 + 34^2 + 0^2 + 11^2 + 111^2 + 9089^2
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the simplicity and power of Python’s list comprehensions and set operations to efficiently compute mathematical results.
It highlights how to handle duplicate values and perform aggregate calculations with minimal code.
