# Common Numbers Finder Program 📝

## Description 📝

This program takes two lines of text as input, where each line contains a sequence of numbers.
The program determines the number of common numbers that appear in both sequences and outputs this count.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to help identify and count the numbers that appear in both input sequences, regardless of their order or frequency in each line.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The program first reads two lines of input, each containing a space-separated list of numbers.
2. **Logic**:
    - The program converts each line into a set of numbers.
    - It then finds the intersection of the two sets, which gives the common numbers between the two sequences.
3. **Output**:
    - The program outputs the count of common numbers between the two sequences.

### Example:

**Input**:

```
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6 7
```

**Output**:

```
3
```

-   In this example, the common numbers between the two sequences are 3, 4, and 5, so the program outputs 3.

## Output 📜

-   The program prints the number of common numbers that appear in both sequences.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first sequence of numbers (space-separated).
3. Enter the second sequence of numbers (space-separated).
4. The program will print the number of common numbers between the two sequences.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple and efficient way to determine the number of numbers shared between two input sequences, useful for tasks involving comparisons between sets of values.
