# Common Numbers in Ascending Order Program 📝

## Description 📝

This program takes two lines of text as input, where each line contains a sequence of numbers.
It determines and outputs all the numbers that appear in both sequences, sorted in ascending order.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to identify and display all the numbers that are common between two input sequences, in ascending order.
This can be useful in cases where you need to compare two datasets and highlight their overlap.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The program first reads two lines of input, each containing a space-separated list of numbers.
2. **Logic**:
    - The program converts both lines into sets of integers.
    - It then computes the intersection of the two sets to find the common numbers.
    - The resulting common numbers are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Output**:
    - The program outputs the common numbers in ascending order, separated by spaces.

### Example:

**Input**:

```
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6 7
```

**Output**:

```
3 4 5
```

-   In this example, the common numbers between the two sequences are 3, 4, and 5, and the program outputs them in ascending order.

## Output 📜

-   The program prints the common numbers between the two sequences, sorted in ascending order.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first sequence of numbers (space-separated).
3. Enter the second sequence of numbers (space-separated).
4. The program will print the common numbers between the two sequences in ascending order.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program efficiently finds and displays the common numbers between two sequences, sorted in ascending order, providing a simple yet effective solution for comparing datasets.
