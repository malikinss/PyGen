# Lesson 16.2: Functions - Final Test (Part 2)

## Description 📝

This lesson consists entirely of theoretical questions designed to test my understanding of Python functions and their usage.
While there are no practical coding tasks in this part, the questions focus on the conceptual aspects of functions, including their syntax, behavior, and applications.

## Purpose 🎯

The aim of this lesson is to deepen my theoretical understanding of functions in Python.
It helps me:

-   Reinforce key concepts about functions.
-   Ensure that I grasp the principles behind function calls, scope, and design.
-   Prepare for the next level of coding challenges by enhancing my knowledge of Python functions.

## Theoretical Questions 📜

In this part, I will be asked 15 theoretical questions related to functions in Python.
These questions will cover a wide range of topics, from function syntax to function behavior, and will test my understanding of concepts like:

-   Function arguments and return values.
-   Function scope and closures.
-   Lambda functions and recursion.

## Conclusion 🚀

Although this lesson doesn't involve practical tasks, it is a crucial step in solidifying my understanding of Python functions.
Mastering the theory behind functions will prepare me for more complex coding challenges in future lessons.

Good luck with the final test, and keep pushing my Python knowledge forward!
