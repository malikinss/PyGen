# Lesson 16.3: Functions - Final Test (Part 3)

## Description 📝

This lesson contains 11 practical tasks that focus on various function-related operations in Python.
Each task requires implementing a specific function to solve a real-world problem, such as sorting, filtering, or performing arithmetic operations. The tasks in this lesson are designed to help me practice and apply my knowledge of Python functions and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to provide hands-on experience in solving problems using functions in Python.
By completing these tasks, I will:

-   Strengthen my understanding of function usage.
-   Learn to work with different types of operations such as sorting, filtering, and function composition.
-   Enhance my ability to manipulate and process data in Python.

## Tasks 🔍

### 1. Concatenate Variable Arguments into a String 🔗

The `concat()` function takes a variable number of arguments and concatenates them into a single string, with an optional separator.

### 2. Product of Odd Numbers in a List 🎯

The `product_of_odds()` function calculates the product of all odd numbers in a list using functional programming techniques such as `filter()` and `reduce()`.

### 3. Printing Quoted Words 🎯

The `print_quoted_words()` function prints each word from a list in double quotes, separated by spaces.

### 4. Removing Palindromic Numbers 🎯

The `remove_palindromes()` function removes palindromic numbers from a list and prints the remaining numbers.

### 5. Sorting Tuples by Arithmetic Mean in Descending Order 🎯

The `sort_by_mean_descending()` function sorts a list of tuples based on the arithmetic mean of the elements in each tuple, in descending order.

### 6. Calling an Arbitrary Function with Arguments 🎯

The `call()` function generalizes calling any function by accepting a function and its arguments, calling it, and returning the result.

### 7. Function Composition 🎯

The `compose()` function returns a new function that applies two functions in sequence (`f(g(x))`), allowing for complex transformations through composition.

### 8. Arithmetic Operations Factory 🎯

The `arithmetic_operation()` function generates a new function that performs a specific arithmetic operation based on an input symbol (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

### 9. Sorting Words Ignoring Case 🎯

The `sort_words()` function sorts a string of words lexicographically, ignoring case while preserving the original casing of each word.

### 10. Gematria Sorting 🎯

The `sort_words_by_gematria()` function sorts words based on their gematria value (the sum of the numerical values of each letter) and alphabetically in case of ties.

### 11. IP Address Sorting 🎯

The `sort_ip_addresses()` function sorts IP addresses in ascending order by converting each IP address from dot-decimal notation to decimal format.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing these tasks, I will gain a deeper understanding of Python functions and learn how to apply them to solve practical problems efficiently.
These exercises will help me build a solid foundation in functional programming techniques and improve my coding skills.
