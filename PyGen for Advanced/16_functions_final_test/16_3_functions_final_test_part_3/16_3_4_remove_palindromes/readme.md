# Removing Palindromic Numbers 🎯

## Description 📝

The `remove_palindromes()` function filters out palindromic numbers from the given list of integers and prints the remaining numbers on one line, separated by a space.

## Purpose 🎯

This function processes a list of integers, removes any palindromic numbers (numbers that read the same forwards and backwards), and prints the result.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **`filter()`**: The `filter()` function is used to remove palindromic numbers. The lambda function compares the string representation of each number to its reverse using slicing (`[::-1]`).
2. **Unpacking operator (`*`)**: The unpacking operator is used to print the filtered numbers, each as a separate argument to the `print()` function, ensuring they are printed on one line.
3. **`str(x) != str(x)[::-1]`**: This checks if the string representation of a number is different from its reverse, effectively removing palindromic numbers.

## Example Output:

```python
>>> numbers = [18, 191, 9009, 5665, 78, 77, 45, 23, 19991, 908, 8976, 6565, 5665, 10, 1000, 908, 909, 232, 45654, 786]
>>> remove_palindromes(numbers)
18 78 45 23 908 8976 10 1000 908 786
```

## Usage 📦

1. The function `remove_palindromes()` takes a list of integers as input.
2. The `filter()` function processes the list, removing any palindromic numbers.
3. The unpacking operator (`*`) prints the filtered list on a single line.

## Conclusion 🚀

This approach efficiently removes palindromic numbers from the list and prints the non-palindromic numbers using Python's `filter()` and the unpacking operator. The code is clean and performs the task with minimal complexity.
