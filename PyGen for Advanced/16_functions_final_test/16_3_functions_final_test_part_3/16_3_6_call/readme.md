# Calling an Arbitrary Function with Arguments 🎯

## Description 📝

The `call()` function takes a function and its arguments, calls the function with those arguments, and returns its result.

## Purpose 🎯

The function generalizes calling any function, passing it a variable number of arguments, and returning the result.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **`Callable[..., Any]`**: This annotation ensures that the `func` argument is a callable (a function), and `*args` allows any number of arguments to be passed to the function.
2. **`func(*args)`**: The function is called with the unpacked `args`, and its result is returned.

## Example Usage:

```python
>>> def add(a, b):
...     return a + b
>>> call(add, 3, 5)
8
```

In this example, `call(add, 3, 5)` calls the `add()` function with arguments `3` and `5`, and returns the result `8`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This simple function is powerful in its generality. It allows us to dynamically call any function with any number of arguments, providing a flexible tool for function execution.
