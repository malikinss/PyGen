# Sorting Tuples by Arithmetic Mean in Descending Order 🎯

## Description 📝

The `sort_by_mean_descending()` function sorts a list of tuples based on the arithmetic mean of the elements in each tuple, in descending order.

## Purpose 🎯

The function processes a list of tuples, calculates the arithmetic mean of the elements in each tuple, and sorts the tuples in descending order based on these mean values.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **`sum(x) / len(x)`**: The arithmetic mean of the elements of each tuple is calculated by summing the elements and dividing by the number of elements.
2. **`sorted()`**: The list is sorted using the calculated mean as the key. The `reverse=True` parameter ensures that the sorting is done in descending order.
3. **Lambda Function**: The lambda function extracts the arithmetic mean of each tuple to be used as the sorting criterion.

## Example Output:

```python
>>> numbers = [
...     (10, -2, 3, 4),
...     (-13, 56),
...     (1, 9, 2),
...     (-1, -9, -45, 32),
...     (-1, 5, 1),
...     (17, 0, 1),
...     (0, 1),
...     (3,),
...     (39, 12),
...     (11, -23),
...     (10, -100, 21, 32),
...     (3, -8),
...     (1, 1)
... ]
>>> sorted_numbers = sort_by_mean_descending(numbers)
>>> print(sorted_numbers)
[(17, 0, 1), (10, -2, 3, 4), (-13, 56), (1, 9, 2), (-1, -9, -45, 32), (-1, 5, 1), (39, 12), (3,), (10, -100, 21, 32), (11, -23), (0, 1), (3, -8), (1, 1)]
```

## Usage 📦

1. The function `sort_by_mean_descending()` takes a list of tuples as input.
2. The arithmetic mean is computed for each tuple.
3. The tuples are sorted based on their mean in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `key` argument.

## Conclusion 🚀

This function effectively sorts a list of tuples based on their arithmetic mean in descending order. By using Python's built-in `sorted()` function and a lambda expression to calculate the mean, the code is both concise and efficient.
