# Lesson 16.1: Functions - Final Test (Part 1)

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I tackle two practical tasks that assess my ability to implement Python functions and work with string formatting.
The focus is on creating functions that generate structured outputs, such as emails and formatted prints, based on specific input parameters.

The tasks in this lesson test my understanding of:

-   String formatting and template generation.
-   List handling and presenting data in a visually appealing way.

## Purpose 🎯

This lesson serves as a final test for mastering function creation, string manipulation, and enhancing the readability of my program outputs.
By completing these tasks, I'll gain more experience in:

-   Generating custom messages for real-world applications (e.g., emails).
-   Formatting lists and outputs to improve the user experience.

## Tasks 📜

1. **Exam Schedule Email Generator 📧**
   This function generates an email based on the provided exam schedule details. It allows the user to specify the exam date, time, place, teacher, and room number. If any details are missing, the function uses default values. The goal is to provide students with all the necessary exam information in a well-formatted email.

2. **Pretty Print List with Frame 🎨**
   The `pretty_print()` function enhances the readability of lists by printing them inside a decorative frame. You can customize the frame's characters and the delimiter between list elements, making the output visually appealing and easy to read.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will have refined my skills in formatting strings and structuring outputs.
These are essential techniques for working with user-facing applications, whether I'm generating emails or presenting data.
Mastering these skills will help me write cleaner and more user-friendly code.
