# Lesson 17.1: File Input and Output

## Description üìù

This lesson introduces the basic concepts related to files in programming.
It covers essential topics such as file types, file access methods, file names, and file encoding.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively working with file input and output (I/O) in Python.
This lesson provides theoretical questions that will deepen my understanding of how to manage and manipulate files programmatically.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Provide an overview of the key concepts related to files.
-   Explain the various file types and methods used to access and manipulate them.
-   Help me understand how to properly handle files in Python, including file encoding and naming conventions.

## Key Topics üîç

### 1. File Concept

This section introduces the concept of files in programming, explaining their role in data storage and management.

### 2. File Input and Output

Learn about reading from and writing to files, which are essential operations for handling data in persistent storage.

### 3. Working with Files

This topic explores how to open, read, write, and close files in Python, including handling file modes such as read (`r`), write (`w`), append (`a`), and binary modes.

### 4. File Types

Understand the different types of files (e.g., text files, binary files) and how to handle them in Python.

### 5. File Access Methods

This section explains the various ways I can access files, including the `open()` function and file access methods such as reading line-by-line or reading all content at once.

### 6. File Names

Learn about the conventions for naming files and how to manage file paths, including relative and absolute paths.

### 7. File Encoding

Understand the importance of file encoding when reading or writing text files. Learn about common encodings like UTF-8 and ASCII.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By understanding the basic principles of file I/O, I will be better equipped to manage data stored in files and use files as part of my programs.
Mastering these concepts will allow me to handle various file types and encoding scenarios effectively, making it easier to work with external data sources in Python.
