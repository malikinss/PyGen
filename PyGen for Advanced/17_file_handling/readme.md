# Chapter 17: File Handling

## Description üìù

In this chapter, I learn how to handle files in Python, covering essential concepts such as file types, file access methods, and file encoding.
The chapter consists of four lessons and 22 practical tasks, focusing on both reading from and writing to text files.
By the end of this chapter, I will be proficient in working with file input and output (I/O), understanding how to manipulate file content, and using context managers for resource management.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this chapter is to provide comprehensive knowledge of file handling in Python. Through a mix of theoretical concepts and practical tasks, I will:

-   Learn how to manage files effectively.
-   Understand key concepts such as file opening, closing, reading, writing, and handling file position.
-   Gain hands-on experience in working with text files, including reading and writing data, using context managers, and manipulating file content.

## Lessons Overview üîç

### 17.1: File Input and Output üìù

This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts related to files in programming. Topics covered include file types, file access methods, file names, and file encoding. These concepts are essential for understanding how to handle file input and output (I/O) effectively in Python.
The goal is to:

-   Provide an overview of key concepts related to files.
-   Explain the different file types and methods for accessing and manipulating them.
-   Understand how to handle files in Python, including file encoding and naming conventions.

### 17.2: Working with Text Files (Part 1) üìù

This lesson focuses on reading data from text files. It covers the basics of file I/O, such as opening and closing files, specifying encoding, and different methods for reading file content.
The goal is to:

-   Learn how to open and close files properly.
-   Understand how to specify encoding when working with text files.
-   Use various methods to read file content:
    -   `read()` ‚Äì Reads the entire file as a string.
    -   `readline()` ‚Äì Reads a single line at a time.
    -   `readlines()` ‚Äì Reads all lines into a list.

### 17.3: Working with Text Files (Part 2) üìù

This lesson continues the exploration of file handling, with a focus on file position and context managers. I will learn how to manage the file cursor position using the `seek()` and `tell()` methods, and work with context managers to ensure proper file handling.
The goal is to:

-   Learn how to manage the cursor position in a file using `seek()` and `tell()`.
-   Understand how to use context managers for efficient and clean file handling.
-   Solve practical problems related to text file manipulation.

### 17.4: Working with Text Files (Part 3) üìù

In this lesson, I focus on writing data to text files. I will learn to use the `write()` and `writelines()` methods to write strings and lists to files. I will also explore handling user input, generating random data, manipulating file content, and merging files.
The goal is to:

-   Understand how to write to files using `write()` and `writelines()`.
-   Learn how to concatenate files and manipulate file content.
-   Develop a solid understanding of file handling for working with external data.

## Output üìú

By the end of this chapter, I will have a thorough understanding of file handling in Python, including:

-   Reading and writing data from/to text files.
-   Using context managers to handle files efficiently.
-   Managing file positions and solving practical file manipulation problems.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This chapter equips me with the necessary skills to handle file input and output in Python. The combination of theoretical lessons and hands-on tasks ensures that I can efficiently work with external data, whether for reading, writing, or manipulating file content. These skills are essential for real-world programming tasks that involve file handling.
