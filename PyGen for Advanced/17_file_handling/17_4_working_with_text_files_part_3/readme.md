# Lesson 17.4: Working with Text Files (Part 3)

## Description 📝

This lesson delves into **writing data** to text files using Python. It covers two key methods for writing to files:

-   `write()` – writes a string to the file.
-   `writelines()` – writes a list of strings to the file.

By the end of this lesson, I will understand how to handle text file operations in Python, including writing user input, generating random data, manipulating file content, and merging files.

## Purpose 🎯

The aim of this lesson is to:

-   Understand how to write to files using the `write()` and `writelines()` methods.
-   Learn how to handle file concatenation and basic data manipulation tasks.
-   Develop a solid understanding of file handling, which is crucial for working with external data.

## Practical Tasks 🚀

### 1️⃣ Write Data to a File ✍️

**Task:** Read a line of text from the user and **write it to a file** named `output.txt`.

-   Demonstrates basic file writing operations.

### 2️⃣ Write List of Random Numbers 🎲

**Task:** Generate **25 random numbers** within the range of 111 to 777 and write each number to a new line in a file named `random.txt`.

-   Useful for understanding how to generate random numbers and save them to a file.

### 3️⃣ Write Enumerated Data 🔢

**Task:** Read the contents of `input.txt`, add a line number to each line, and write the result to `output.txt` with the format `N) line_text`.

-   Demonstrates how to read, modify, and write formatted data to a file.

### 4️⃣ Write New Scores 🏅

**Task:** Read a file `class_scores.txt`, add **5 points to each score**, and write the updated results to a file `new_scores.txt` (scores cannot exceed 100).

-   Shows file manipulation, string formatting, and basic mathematical operations.

### 5️⃣ Solve Fresko Task 🐐

**Task:** Read a file `goats.txt` containing goat colors and occurrences, and find the colors that make up more than 7% of the total number of goats. Write the result to `answer.txt`.

-   Demonstrates **data filtering**, string manipulation, and percentage calculations.

### 6️⃣ Concatenate Files 🔗

**Task:** Read a list of files, concatenate their contents in the given order, and write the combined data to `output.txt`.

-   Useful for **merging multiple files** into one without changing their order.

### 7️⃣ Get Users Who Spent More Than an Hour 🕐

**Task:** Process a log file `logfile.txt` containing user login and logout times. Filter users who were logged in for at least **one hour** and write their names to `output.txt`.

-   Great for understanding how to process logs and filter data based on time.

## Conclusion 🎯

In this lesson, I learned how to **write data to text files** using Python and how to perform several essential tasks like generating random data, manipulating file contents, and merging files. These skills are foundational for file-based operations in Python.
