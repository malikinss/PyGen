# Sum of Two Numbers from a File 🔢

## Description 📝

This program reads a file named **"numbers.txt"**, which contains **two integers**, and prints their **sum**.

## Purpose 🎯

A simple file-handling task to demonstrate **reading, processing, and computing** data from a text file.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **File Reading (`get_data_from_file`)**:

    - Opens the file in **read mode (`'r'`)** with UTF-8 encoding.
    - Reads **two lines**, converts them to integers, and returns a list.

2. **Summation (`get_sum_of_data`)**:
    - Uses Python’s built-in `sum()` to compute the total.

## Example Usage:

**File (`numbers.txt`):**

```
25
75
```

**Program Output:**

```python
>>> 100
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This script efficiently extracts two numbers from a file and **calculates their sum**, making it a great example of basic file handling in Python! 📂➕
