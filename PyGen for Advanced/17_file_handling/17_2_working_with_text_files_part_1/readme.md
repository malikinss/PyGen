# Lesson 17.2: Working with Text Files (Part 1)

## Description 📝

This lesson introduces working with text files in Python, focusing on **reading data** from files.
It covers fundamental operations such as opening and closing files, specifying encoding, and different methods for reading file content. Understanding file I/O is essential for handling external data sources efficiently.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Learn how to **open and close** files properly.
-   Understand how to **specify encoding** when working with text files.
-   Use various methods to **read** file content, such as:
    -   `read()` – Reads the entire file as a string.
    -   `readline()` – Reads a **single line** at a time.
    -   `readlines()` – Reads **all lines** into a list.

## Practical Tasks 🚀

### 1️⃣ Display File Contents 📄

**Task:** Read a file name from user input and **display its contents** on the screen.

-   If the file does not exist or cannot be read, an **error message** is shown.
-   Useful for **quickly viewing** a text file without opening an editor.

### 2️⃣ Get Penultimate Line 📜

**Task:** Read a file name from user input and **display the second-to-last line** of the file.

-   Useful for retrieving the **penultimate line** without manually opening the file.

### 3️⃣ Get Random Line 📜

**Task:** Read a file named `"lines.txt"` and **print a random line** from it.

-   Useful for selecting a random **phrase, log entry, or data point** from a file.

### 4️⃣ Get Sum of Data 🔢

**Task:** Read a file named `"numbers.txt"` containing **two integers** and print their **sum**.

-   Demonstrates basic file reading and numerical computations.

### 5️⃣ Get Sum of Numbers from a File 📄➕

**Task:** Read a file named `"nums.txt"` containing **two integers separated by spaces or new lines** and print their **sum**.

-   Similar to the previous task but allows more **flexible formatting**.

### 6️⃣ Get Total Price of Order 🛒💰

**Task:** Read a file named `"prices.txt"` containing **order details** in a tab-separated format.  
Each line contains:

-   **Product name**
-   **Quantity (integer)**
-   **Price per unit (integer)**

💡 The program **computes and displays** the **total cost** of all products in the order.

## Conclusion 🎯

This lesson provides a **hands-on introduction** to working with **text files** in Python.  
By mastering **file reading techniques**, I will be able to **process, analyze, and manipulate** text-based data in real-world applications.
