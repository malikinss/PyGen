# Triangle Drawing with Turtle Graphics

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw an equilateral triangle.
The triangle is drawn with a specified side length.
The program defines a function `triangle(side)` that takes the side length of the triangle as input and draws the triangle on the screen.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to create a regular triangle. It shows how to draw shapes by moving the turtle forward and turning at specified angles.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The user provides the side length of the equilateral triangle.
2. **Processing**:
    - The Turtle graphics module is used to draw the triangle by moving the turtle forward for the length of the side and turning at 120-degree angles, which forms the three equal sides of the triangle.
3. **Output**:
    - The program visually draws an equilateral triangle with the given side length.

## Output 📜

The program draws an equilateral triangle with the specified side length using Turtle graphics.

### Example:

For the input:

```
side = 150
```

The output will be an equilateral triangle with a side length of 150 pixels.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `triangle_drawing.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python triangle_drawing.py`
5. Enter the side length when prompted.
6. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the triangle.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to draw a regular triangle.
It provides a simple introduction to geometric shapes and Turtle commands.
