# Rectangle Drawing with Turtle Graphics

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a rectangle.
The rectangle is drawn with specified width and height.
The program defines a function `rectangle(width, height)` that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input and draws it on the screen.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to create a simple shape.
The program helps in understanding basic Turtle commands and geometry.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The user provides two integers representing the width and height of the rectangle.
2. **Processing**:
    - The Turtle graphics module is used to draw the rectangle by moving the turtle forward and turning at 90-degree angles to form the four sides.
3. **Output**:
    - The program visually draws a rectangle with the specified dimensions.

## Output 📜

The program draws a rectangle with the provided width and height using Turtle graphics.

### Example:

For the input:

```
width = 200
height = 100
```

The output will be a rectangle with a width of 200 and height of 100.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `rectangle_drawing.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python rectangle_drawing.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the rectangle.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to draw shapes.
It provides a simple introduction to drawing with Turtle and handling basic geometric shapes programmatically.
