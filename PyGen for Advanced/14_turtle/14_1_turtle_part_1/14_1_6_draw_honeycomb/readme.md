# Drawing a Honeycomb using Turtle Graphics

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a honeycomb pattern made up of regular hexagons. The `hexagon(side)` function draws individual hexagons, and the `draw_honeycomb(side, rows, cols)` function arranges them in a grid-like honeycomb pattern.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to draw a honeycomb pattern by repeating hexagons. It illustrates the process of arranging shapes in a grid and how to use Turtle graphics to move and rotate the turtle to position each hexagon correctly.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Hexagon Drawing**:
    - The `hexagon(side)` function draws a regular hexagon with the given side length. It ensures the turtle returns to its starting position after drawing each hexagon.
2. **Honeycomb Construction**:

    - The `draw_honeycomb(side, rows, cols)` function arranges the hexagons into a honeycomb pattern by repeatedly drawing hexagons, adjusting the turtle's position and orientation after each one.

3. **Output**:
    - A honeycomb pattern is displayed in the Turtle graphics window. The pattern consists of hexagons arranged in a grid, with the number of rows and columns determined by the input.

## Output 📜

The program will draw a honeycomb pattern with hexagons, each of the specified side length. The number of hexagons arranged will depend on the number of rows and columns specified.

### Example:

For the input:

```
side = 50
rows = 6
cols = 6
```

The output will be a honeycomb made of 6 rows and 6 columns of hexagons, each with a side length of 50 pixels.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `honeycomb.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python honeycomb.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the honeycomb pattern.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to create a visually appealing honeycomb pattern using Python's Turtle graphics module. It combines geometric principles like hexagon symmetry with the power of Turtle for creating grid-based shapes.
