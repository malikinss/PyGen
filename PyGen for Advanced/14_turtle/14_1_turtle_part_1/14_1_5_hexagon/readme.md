# Drawing a Regular Hexagon using Turtle Graphics

## Description üìù

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a regular hexagon. The function `hexagon(side)` is used to draw the hexagon, where the side length is provided as input, and the turtle draws six sides of equal length, each with an angle of 60 degrees between them.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to draw a regular hexagon. It shows how to move the turtle and adjust the angle between each side to form a six-sided polygon.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Input**:
    - The user provides the side length of the hexagon.
    - The program uses the turtle to draw six equal-length sides, each with a 60-degree internal angle between them.
2. **Processing**:
    - The `hexagon(side)` function moves the turtle forward by the side length and then turns it 60 degrees to form each side of the hexagon. This process is repeated six times to complete the hexagon.
3. **Output**:
    - The program visually draws a regular hexagon with the specified side length.

## Output üìú

The program draws a regular hexagon with six sides, each of the specified length, arranged symmetrically.

### Example:

For the input:

```
side = 100
```

The output will be a regular hexagon with each side 100 pixels long, with equal angles between the sides.

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `hexagon.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python hexagon.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the regular hexagon.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program demonstrates how to use Python's Turtle graphics module to draw a regular hexagon. It showcases basic movement and turning techniques, as well as how to create geometric shapes by adjusting the turtle's direction.
