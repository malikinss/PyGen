# Drawing a Regular Five-Pointed Star

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a regular five-pointed star. The `draw_five_pointed_star(side_length)` function creates the star by drawing five sides and turning the turtle by 144 degrees to form the star's points.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to draw a regular five-pointed star using Python's Turtle graphics module. By using a specific rotation angle (144°), the turtle forms a symmetrical star shape.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Drawing the Star**:
    - The `draw_five_pointed_star(side_length)` function draws the first side of the star, then turns the turtle by 144 degrees to create the next side. This process repeats five times to complete the star.
2. **Rotation Angle**:
    - The rotation angle of 144 degrees ensures that the star’s points are evenly spaced, forming a regular five-pointed star.

## Output 📜

The program will display a five-pointed star, with each side having the specified length. The points of the star will be symmetrically spaced, forming a regular star shape.

### Example:

For the input:

```
side_length = 150
```

The output will be a five-pointed star with sides of length 150 pixels.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `five_pointed_star.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python five_pointed_star.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the five-pointed star.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to use Turtle graphics to draw a regular five-pointed star with specific angles. It highlights how to use rotation to create a symmetric shape with evenly spaced points.
