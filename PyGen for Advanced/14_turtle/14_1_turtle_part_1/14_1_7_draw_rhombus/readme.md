# Drawing a Rhombus using Turtle Graphics

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a rhombus with angles of 60 and 120 degrees. The `draw_rhombus(side)` function takes a side length as input and draws the rhombus shape based on that.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to draw a rhombus using Turtle graphics by combining turns at 60 and 120 degrees. This showcases the use of simple geometry and Turtle's movement capabilities.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Rhombus Drawing**:

    - The `draw_rhombus(side)` function draws a rhombus with two distinct angles: 60 degrees and 120 degrees. It repeats the drawing steps twice:
        - Draw the first side and turn 60 degrees.
        - Draw the opposite side and turn 120 degrees.

2. **Output**:
    - A rhombus shape is drawn, with each side having the specified length and the angles between adjacent sides being 60 and 120 degrees.

## Output 📜

The program will display a rhombus, with each side of the specified length and the angles between adjacent sides being 60 and 120 degrees.

### Example:

For the input:

```
side = 100
```

The output will be a rhombus with a side length of 100 pixels and angles of 60 and 120 degrees.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `rhombus.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python rhombus.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the rhombus.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to create a rhombus shape using Turtle graphics, illustrating the use of specific angles (60 and 120 degrees) and side lengths in geometric drawing.
