# Lesson 14.1 - Turtle Graphics: Drawing Geometric Shapes with Python 🐢

## Description 📝

In this section, I explore the basics of Turtle graphics, a popular Python module used to create drawings and animations.
I will learn to draw various geometric shapes, manipulate the turtle's direction, and design intricate patterns.
This section introduces concepts like controlling the turtle’s movement, drawing basic shapes, and creating more complex designs by combining these shapes.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this section is to help me get comfortable with the Turtle graphics module by creating simple shapes and patterns, using loops, rotation, and geometric principles.
By the end of this section, I will have a good understanding of how to control the turtle and draw shapes with it.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The `turtle` module provides a turtle object that can be controlled with various commands.
-   Functions like `forward()`, `left()`, `right()`, and `penup()` control the turtle's movement.
-   Shapes like squares, triangles, and stars are created by using loops and rotating the turtle at specific angles.
-   The section contains 12 tasks, each designed to explore different geometric patterns and shapes.

## Output 📜

-   The output of these tasks will be various geometric shapes and patterns drawn on the Turtle graphics window.
-   Tasks include drawing a rectangle, triangle, hexagon, star, nested squares, honeycomb, and spiral.

## Usage 📦

1. Make sure you have Python installed and the `turtle` module available (it’s included in Python's standard library).
2. For each task, simply run the Python file that corresponds to the shape you want to draw.
3. The Turtle window will appear, and you will see the shape or pattern being drawn in real time.
4. Experiment by changing parameters like side lengths or angles to create different designs.

### Example Usage:

To draw a rectangle:

```bash
python 14_1_1_rectangle.py
```

This will draw a rectangle with specified width and height.

To draw a triangle:

```bash
python 14_1_2_triangle.py
```

Repeat this for the rest of the tasks in this section.

## Tasks List 📚

1. **14_1_1_rectangle** - Draw a rectangle.
2. **14_1_2_triangle** - Draw an equilateral triangle.
3. **14_1_3_draw_squares** - Draw a figure made of three squares.
4. **14_1_4_draw_figure** - Draw a figure made of eight squares arranged in a circular pattern.
5. **14_1_5_hexagon** - Draw a regular hexagon.
6. **14_1_6_draw_honeycomb** - Draw a honeycomb pattern using hexagons.
7. **14_1_7_draw_rhombus** - Draw a rhombus shape.
8. **14_1_8_draw_snowflake** - Draw a snowflake made of diamonds.
9. **14_1_9_draw_star_rays** - Draw the rays of a star.
10. **14_1_10_draw_five_pointed_star** - Draw a regular five-pointed star.
11. **14_1_11_draw_nested_squares** - Draw nested squares.
12. **14_1_12_draw_spiral** - Draw a spiral pattern made of rectangles.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this section, I will gain a solid foundation in Turtle graphics, allowing me to draw geometric shapes and create interesting designs.
I can build on this knowledge to create more advanced graphical programs using Python’s Turtle module.
I'll keep experimenting with different shapes, angles, and patterns to enhance my skills!
