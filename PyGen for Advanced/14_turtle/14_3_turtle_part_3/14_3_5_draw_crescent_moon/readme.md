# Crescent Moon Drawing Program

## Description üìù

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a crescent moon on a night sky background. The crescent shape is created by drawing two overlapping circles, one representing the moon and the other representing the 'cut-out' part of the crescent.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how Turtle graphics can be used to create complex shapes by layering simple geometric forms. Specifically, it shows how overlapping circles can be used to create the crescent moon effect.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Setting Up the Background**:

    - The screen is set up with a custom size of 380x480 pixels, representing the night sky.
    - The background color is set to a dark blue color (`rgb(2, 27, 157)`), which simulates the night sky.

2. **Drawing the Full Moon**:

    - The first circle is drawn to represent the full moon. It's a large yellow circle placed at the center of the screen.

3. **Creating the Crescent Effect**:

    - A second smaller circle is drawn over the full moon, positioned in such a way that it overlaps with the first circle, creating the crescent shape.
    - The color of the smaller circle matches the background color, effectively 'cutting out' a portion of the moon.

4. **Completion**:
    - The result is a crescent moon on a night sky background.

## Output üìú

The output is a crescent moon against a dark blue sky. The moon is yellow, and the cut-out portion of the moon is made by drawing a smaller circle with the same color as the background.

### Example:

A Turtle graphics window will appear displaying a crescent moon, with the night sky as the background.

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `crescent_moon.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python crescent_moon.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and draw the crescent moon.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program demonstrates how to use basic geometric shapes, like circles, to create more complex visual effects, such as the crescent moon. It's a simple yet effective example of graphical programming using Turtle.
