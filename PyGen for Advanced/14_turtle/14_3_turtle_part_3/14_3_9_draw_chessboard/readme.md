# Chessboard Drawing Program

## Description üìù

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw an 8x8 chessboard, with alternating black and white squares. The size of the chessboard and the individual squares can be easily adjusted. The program utilizes the `turtle` module to create the chessboard visually and demonstrate the use of coordinate-based drawing and color alternation.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use the Turtle graphics library for drawing a chessboard with alternating square colors (black and white). It provides an example of how to create grid-based drawings and control the turtle‚Äôs position and color.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Setting Up the Turtle**:

    - The turtle is configured with the fastest drawing speed and hidden to avoid unnecessary visual distraction. Its pen is lifted so it doesn't draw unnecessary lines while moving to positions.

2. **Calculating Square Positions**:

    - For each square on the chessboard, the program calculates the exact coordinates of its center based on its row and column on the board, adjusting for the overall board size.

3. **Determining Square Colors**:

    - The color of each square is determined by its position. If the sum of the row and column is even, the square is white; if odd, the square is black. This pattern alternates to form the classic chessboard layout.

4. **Drawing the Chessboard**:

    - The program loops through all the squares on the chessboard, determines their color, calculates their position, and draws them using the `stamp` method to place a square-shaped turtle at each position.

5. **Output**:
    - The output is a graphical 8x8 chessboard drawn in the Turtle graphics window.

## Output üìú

The output is a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns, each square alternating between black and white. The board is drawn using the Turtle graphics library, which opens in a new window. The size of each square and the entire board can be customized by changing the `square_size` and `board_size` variables.

### Example:

A graphical representation of a chessboard with alternating black and white squares.

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `chessboard.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python chessboard.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window displaying the chessboard.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program demonstrates how to use the Turtle graphics library for drawing grid-based patterns, calculating positions, and controlling turtle behavior. It offers an example of a simple graphical representation of a chessboard, which could be extended to create more complex chess-related programs or used as a visual reference for understanding coordinate-based drawing in programming.
