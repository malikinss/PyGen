# STOP Sign Drawing Program

## Description üìù

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a STOP sign. The program first draws an octagonal border with alternating colors (black, white, and red) to represent the shape of the STOP sign. Then, the word "STOP" is written in bold white letters at the center of the sign.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to draw regular polygons and add text in Turtle graphics. The program focuses on creating a realistic representation of a STOP sign using geometric shapes and text placement.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Drawing the Polygon**:

    - The `draw_polygon()` function is responsible for drawing a regular polygon with a specified number of sides, side length, and color. It uses the turtle to move forward by the side length and rotates the turtle to create each side of the polygon.

2. **Drawing the STOP Sign**:

    - The `draw_stop_sign()` function coordinates the drawing process:
        - It starts by drawing an octagon with a black color.
        - Then, a smaller white octagon is drawn inside to create the border effect.
        - A red octagon is drawn inside the white border to represent the main body of the STOP sign.
        - Finally, the word "STOP" is written in the center of the sign using a large white font.

3. **Turtle Graphics**:
    - The program uses Turtle graphics to draw the polygons and write text. The turtle moves to the correct positions and uses the `penup()` and `pendown()` commands to control when the drawing should occur.
4. **Final Output**:
    - The result is a graphic representation of a STOP sign with a black border, a white inner border, a red main area, and the word "STOP" centered in white text.

## Output üìú

The output is a graphical representation of a STOP sign:

-   A large octagonal red sign with white and black borders.
-   The word "STOP" written in white, bold font at the center of the sign.

### Example:

A graphical depiction of the STOP sign:

-   **Black Border** (outermost octagon).
-   **White Border** (inner octagon).
-   **Red Main Area** (the central part of the sign).
-   **STOP Text** (written in bold white font in the middle).

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `stop_sign.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python stop_sign.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window displaying the STOP sign.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program creates a simple yet realistic drawing of a STOP sign using the Turtle graphics library. It demonstrates how to draw polygons and place text in a graphical window. The program can be further enhanced to include animations or additional graphical elements.
