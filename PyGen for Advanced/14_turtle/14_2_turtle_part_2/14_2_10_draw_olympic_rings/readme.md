# Drawing the Olympic Symbol

## Description üìù

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw the iconic Olympic symbol, consisting of five interlocking rings. The rings are drawn using different colors and positioned in a specific arrangement to replicate the official Olympic symbol.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to use Turtle graphics to create a complex design by drawing several interlocking circles. It showcases the use of functions to control the turtle's movement and the application of colors.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Movement**:
    - The program uses the `move_to` function to move the turtle to the correct position without drawing any lines.
2. **Drawing the Rings**:

    - Five rings are drawn in total, each with a specific color.
    - The turtle moves to each predefined coordinate and then draws a circle with a radius of 50 pixels. The colors of the rings are set to blue, black, red, yellow, and green, corresponding to the official Olympic ring colors.

3. **Ring Positioning**:
    - The rings are positioned in a specific pattern with three rings in the top row and two rings in the bottom row, forming the familiar Olympic symbol.

## Output üìú

The program will display the Olympic symbol consisting of five interlocking rings in the following colors:

-   Blue
-   Black
-   Red
-   Yellow
-   Green

### Example:

The output will show five rings arranged as follows:

```
Blue ring | Black ring | Red ring
Yellow ring | Green ring
```

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `olympic_symbol.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python olympic_symbol.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and display the Olympic rings.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program provides an easy way to draw the Olympic symbol using Turtle graphics. It demonstrates the use of loops, functions, and color management to create a detailed design.
