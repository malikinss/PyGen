# Drawing a Teddy Bear

## Description 📝

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a cute teddy bear. The teddy bear is created by drawing several shapes, including circles for the head, ears, eyes, snout, and nose. The program showcases how to combine basic shapes to form a more complex figure.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to draw a teddy bear using the Turtle graphics library. It highlights how to organize drawing tasks into functions to keep the code clean and readable. The program also uses the concepts of shapes and colors to create a friendly and recognizable figure.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Drawing the Head**:
    - The `draw_head` function creates the main part of the teddy bear's face, including a large circle for the head and a smaller circle for the snout.
2. **Drawing the Ears**:
    - The `draw_ears` function places two smaller circles at the top-left and top-right of the head to represent the ears.
3. **Drawing the Eyes**:
    - The `draw_eyes` function creates two smaller filled circles to represent the teddy bear's eyes.
4. **Drawing the Nose**:

    - The `draw_nose` function creates a small filled circle at the center of the snout to represent the bear's nose.

5. **Putting It All Together**:
    - The `draw_teddy_bear` function calls all the other functions to draw the complete teddy bear.

## Output 📜

The output is an image of a teddy bear drawn using circles. The teddy bear features:

-   A large head
-   Two ears at the top
-   Two eyes on the face
-   A nose at the center of the snout

### Example:

The output will look like a friendly teddy bear, with a brown body, black eyes and nose, and a warm smile.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `teddy_bear.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python teddy_bear.py`
5. The program will open a Turtle graphics window and display the teddy bear.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to draw a simple and cute teddy bear using Turtle graphics. It provides an example of how to break down a drawing into smaller functions and manage colors and shapes effectively.
