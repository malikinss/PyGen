# Lesson 10.4: Practice Tasks with Dictionaries Lesson üìö

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I tackle 7 practical tasks related to Python dictionaries. The tasks are designed to enhance my understanding of how to use dictionaries effectively in real-world scenarios, such as checking anagrams, managing phonebooks, finding synonyms, and more.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Strengthen my understanding of dictionary operations.
-   Provide practical examples of how dictionaries can be used in different types of programs.
-   Solve real-world problems by applying the knowledge of dictionaries.

## Key Concepts üìö

1. **10_4_1_query_dictionary**  
   This program creates and queries a small dictionary of programming slang expressions. It allows users to input terms and their definitions, storing them in a dictionary for future reference. Users can then query the dictionary to retrieve definitions of the terms.

    **Purpose**: Help programmers organize and reference their growing lexicon of slang and technical jargon.

2. **10_4_2_are_anagrams**  
   This program determines whether two given words are anagrams. It checks if the words contain the same letters in a different order, ignoring case differences.

    **Purpose**: Verify if two words are anagrams, useful in linguistic and cryptographic contexts.

3. **10_4_3_are_sentences_anagrams**  
   This program checks if two given sentences are anagrams by removing spaces, punctuation, and case differences before comparing the characters.

    **Purpose**: Check if two sentences are anagrams, helpful in language processing, cryptography, or word games.

4. **10_4_4_find_synonym**  
   This program retrieves a synonym for a given word based on a dictionary of word pairs. The dictionary is constructed from pairs of synonymous words inputted by the user.

    **Purpose**: Provide an easy way to look up synonyms from a predefined dictionary.

5. **10_4_5_process_city_queries**  
   This program helps users map cities to their corresponding countries. For each queried city, the program outputs the country it belongs to, based on a predefined list.

    **Purpose**: Quickly identify the country of a given city for educational purposes, geography games, or other applications.

6. **10_4_6_find_numbers**  
   This program allows users to store and search for phone numbers in a phonebook. It builds the phonebook from a list of names and phone numbers and allows quick retrieval of contact information.

    **Purpose**: Store and retrieve phone numbers for a group of friends, providing quick access to contact information.

7. **10_4_7_get_decrypted_string**  
   This program decrypts a secret word using frequency analysis. It processes the encrypted string, mapping character frequencies to a predefined distribution to reveal the correct substitutions.

    **Purpose**: Demonstrate cryptanalysis using frequency analysis to decrypt a message.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By solving these tasks, I will gain hands-on experience with Python dictionaries, improving your ability to use them in diverse scenarios such as cryptography, data organization, and more. Understanding how to manipulate dictionaries is a key skill for any programmer working with Python.
