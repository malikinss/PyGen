# Section 10: Dictionaries 🗂️

This section consists of 32 practical tasks and introduces the powerful data structure known as dictionaries in Python.
I’ll explore their features, perform manipulations, and tackle real-world problems using key-value pairs.

## Description 📝

This section is divided into five lessons:

-   **10_1_intro** – Introduction to dictionaries, their structure, and how they differ from other collections.
-   **10_2_basic_manipulations** – Learn basic operations with dictionaries, including built-in functions, iteration, and formatted output.
-   **10_3_methods** – Explore dictionary methods such as `get()`, `update()`, `pop()`, `setdefault()`, and others.
-   **10_4_practice_tasks** – Apply my knowledge through 7 practical tasks solving real-world problems with dictionaries.
-   **10_5_nested_dicts_and_generators** – Understand and manipulate nested dictionaries and learn dictionary comprehensions.

By completing these lessons, I will gain a comprehensive understanding of dictionaries and their applications in Python.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this section is to:

-   Introduce dictionaries and their features as a key-value mapping collection.
-   Teach basic manipulations and methods to work efficiently with dictionaries.
-   Provide practical tasks that demonstrate the real-world applications of dictionaries.
-   Explore advanced concepts such as nested dictionaries and comprehensions.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Start with 10_1_intro** to understand the structure and use cases of dictionaries.
2. **Learn 10_2_basic_manipulations** to perform common operations and manipulations.
3. **Explore 10_3_methods** to master dictionary-specific methods for modifying and querying data.
4. **Practice in 10_4_practice_tasks** by solving tasks such as checking anagrams, managing phonebooks, and more.
5. **Advance to 10_5_nested_dicts_and_generators** to manipulate nested dictionaries and use comprehensions effectively.

## Output 📜

By the end of this section, I will:

-   Understand the core features and methods of dictionaries.
-   Solve practical problems using dictionaries as a key-value mapping structure.
-   Manipulate nested dictionaries and master dictionary comprehensions.

## Usage 📦

1. Start with **10_1_intro** to build a solid foundation.
2. Proceed to **10_2_basic_manipulations** and **10_3_methods** for operational and method-based learning.
3. Solve tasks in **10_4_practice_tasks** to test and reinforce my skills.
4. Explore **10_5_nested_dicts_and_generators** for advanced techniques and scenarios.

## Conclusion 🚀

This section equips me with the knowledge and skills to use dictionaries effectively in Python programming.
By completing the lessons and tasks, I’ll master both the fundamentals and advanced techniques, enabling me to apply dictionaries to solve a wide variety of problems in programming.
