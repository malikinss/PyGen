# Sum of Minimum and Maximum Keys in Dictionary 🔢

## Description 📝

This program calculates and prints the sum of the minimum and maximum keys in a given dictionary where the keys are numeric (either integers or floats).
It demonstrates how to retrieve and compute with dictionary keys.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to find the smallest and largest numeric keys in a dictionary and return their sum.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - A dictionary with numeric keys (either integers or floats).
2. **Processing**:
    - The program calculates the smallest (`min`) and largest (`max`) keys in the dictionary.
3. **Output**:
    - The program returns and prints the sum of the smallest and largest keys.

## Output 📜

The program outputs a single number, which is the sum of the minimum and maximum keys in the dictionary.

### Example:

**Input**:

```python
my_dict = {
    1.12: 'aa',
    67.9: 45,
    3.11: 'ccc',
    7.9: 'dd',
    9.2: 'ee',
    7.1: 'ff',
    0.12: 'qq',
    1.91: 'aa',
    10.12: [1, 2, 3],
    99.0: {9, 0, 1}
}
```

**Output**:

```plaintext
100.12
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `sum_min_max_keys.py`.
2. Run the script to calculate the sum of the smallest and largest keys.
3. The program will display the result.

### Example Run:

```plaintext
Output: 100.12
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program efficiently calculates the sum of the minimum and maximum numeric keys in a dictionary, providing a quick way to analyze key ranges in such data structures.
