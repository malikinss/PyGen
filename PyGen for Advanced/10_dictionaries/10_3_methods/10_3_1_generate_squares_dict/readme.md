# Generate Squares Dictionary 📘

## Description 📝

This program generates a dictionary where the keys are numbers within a specified range, and the values are the squares of the respective keys. It demonstrates the use of Python's dictionary comprehensions for efficient data creation.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to create a mapping of numbers to their squares for a given range, showcasing an efficient approach to dictionary construction.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - Start and end numbers defining the range (inclusive).
2. **Processing**:
    - A dictionary comprehension iterates through the range of numbers.
    - For each number, the program computes the square and adds it as a key-value pair to the dictionary.
3. **Output**:
    - A dictionary where each key is a number in the range, and its value is the square of the key.

## Output 📜

The program doesn't print the dictionary but stores it in the `result` variable.

### Example:

**Input**:

```python
start = 1
end = 15
```

**Output**:

```python
result = {
    1: 1,
    2: 4,
    3: 9,
    4: 16,
    5: 25,
    6: 36,
    7: 49,
    8: 64,
    9: 81,
    10: 100,
    11: 121,
    12: 144,
    13: 169,
    14: 196,
    15: 225
}
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `generate_squares_dict.py`.
2. Define the range by modifying the `start` and `end` arguments in the function call.
3. Run the script, and the `result` variable will contain the generated dictionary.

### Example Run:

```python
result = generate_squares_dict(1, 15)
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program offers a concise and effective way to generate dictionaries with numerical keys and their squares as values, a useful pattern for various computational tasks in Python.
