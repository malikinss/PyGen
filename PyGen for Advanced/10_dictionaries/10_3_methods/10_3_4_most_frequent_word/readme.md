# Most Frequent Word 📘

## Description 📝

This program finds the most frequently occurring word in a given string `s`. If there are multiple words with the same frequency, it returns the lexicographically smallest one.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to analyze a given string and determine which word occurs the most. In the case of a tie in frequency, the word that comes first in lexicographic order is chosen. This can be useful for tasks like text analysis or identifying the most common words in a body of text.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - A string `s` containing words separated by spaces.
2. **Processing**:
    - The function splits the string into words.
    - It counts the occurrences of each word using a dictionary.
    - It identifies the word(s) with the highest frequency.
    - If there are multiple words with the same frequency, it selects the lexicographically smallest word.
3. **Output**:
    - A string representing the most frequent word in the input string.

## Output 📜

The program prints the most frequently occurring word. In case of a tie, it prints the lexicographically smallest one.

### Example:

**Input**:

```python
s = 'orange strawberry barley gooseberry apple apricot barley currant orange melon pomegranate banana banana orange barley apricot plum grapefruit banana quince strawberry barley grapefruit banana grapes melon strawberry apricot currant currant gooseberry raspberry apricot currant orange lime quince apricot currant orange lime quince grapefruit barley banana melon pomegranate barley banana orange barley apricot plum banana quince lime grapefruit strawberry gooseberry apple barley apricot currant orange melon pomegranate banana banana orange apricot barley plum banana grapefruit banana quince currant orange melon pomegranate barley plum banana quince barley lime grapefruit pomegranate barley'
```

**Output**:

```python
'banana'
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `most_frequent_word.py`.
2. Define the string `s` containing the words to analyze.
3. Call the function `most_frequent_word(s)` to get the most frequent word.

### Example Run:

```python
result = most_frequent_word(s)
print(result)
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This function is an efficient way to find the most frequent word in a string and handle ties by selecting the lexicographically smallest word. It can be applied to text analysis, content summarization, or word frequency analysis.
