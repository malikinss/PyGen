# Count Character Occurrences 📘

## Description 📝

This program counts the number of occurrences of each character in a given text string. It returns a dictionary where each character is a key and the value represents how many times that character appears in the string.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to analyze the frequency of each character in a given string and return a dictionary with the counts, which can be useful for tasks like text analysis or pattern recognition.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - A string of text (`text`).
2. **Processing**:
    - The function iterates over each character in the string.
    - For each character, it updates the count in a dictionary, using the character as the key.
    - If the character already exists in the dictionary, its value is incremented; otherwise, it is initialized to 1.
3. **Output**:
    - A dictionary where the keys are characters and the values are their counts.

## Output 📜

The program does not print the result, but stores it in the `result` variable.

### Example:

**Input**:

```python
text = 'footballcyberpunkextraterritorialityconversationalistblockophthalmoscopicinterdependencemamauserfff'
```

**Output**:

```python
result = {
    'f': 9, 'o': 7, 't': 7, 'b': 2, 'a': 6, 'l': 4, 'c': 5, 'y': 2,
    'e': 6, 'r': 4, 'p': 3, 'u': 2, 'n': 4, 'k': 1, 'x': 1, 'i': 6,
    's': 4, 'v': 1, 'h': 2, 'm': 3, 'd': 2
}
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `count_characters.py`.
2. Define the string `text` for which you want to count the character occurrences.
3. Call the function `count_character_occurrences(text)` to get the dictionary.

### Example Run:

```python
result = count_character_occurrences(text)
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This function is a simple and efficient way to count the occurrences of characters in a given text string, useful for various text processing tasks.
