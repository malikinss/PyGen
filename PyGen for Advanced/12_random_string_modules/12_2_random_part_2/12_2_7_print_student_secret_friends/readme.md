# Secret Friend Assignment Program

## Description 📝

This program randomly assigns each student a secret friend who will work with them on programming problems.
The program ensures that no one is assigned to themselves and that each student only has one secret friend.

## Purpose 🎯

The main purpose of this program is to facilitate a "secret friend" assignment for students, where each student is paired with another randomly.
It ensures fairness by making sure no one is paired with themselves.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of students.
2. It then collects the names of all the students.
3. The list of students is shuffled to randomize the pairings.
4. The program pairs each student with another (ensuring no one is paired with themselves) and outputs the list of pairs.

## Output 📜

The program prints the name of each student followed by their assigned secret friend in the format:

```
Student Name - Secret Friend Name
```

Example output:

```
Alice - Bob
Bob - Charlie
Charlie - Alice
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of students (e.g., 3).
3. Input the names of the students one by one.
4. The program will output the secret friend pairings.

Example usage:

```bash
Enter the number of students: 3
Enter student's name: Alice
Enter student's name: Bob
Enter student's name: Charlie
Alice - Bob
Bob - Charlie
Charlie - Alice
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program ensures fair and random pairing for students to work on programming tasks together.
It can be easily customized or expanded to fit other similar scenarios.
