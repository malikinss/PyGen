# Lesson 12.1: Random Part 1 📚

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on the `random` module in Python, which provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers.
The lesson demonstrates how randomness can be applied to simulate various real-world events and generate unique values.
Tasks include simulating coin tosses, dice throws, generating random passwords, and selecting lottery numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to Python's `random` module and its capabilities in simulating random events and generating random values. Through practical tasks, I will understand the concept of pseudo-randomness and learn how to apply it in programming scenarios like games and security.

## Tasks 📜

### 1. 12_1_1 Simulate Coin Tosses 🪙

This program simulates tossing a coin a specified number of times using Python's `random` module. It outputs the result of each toss as either "Heads" or "Tails".
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of randomness in simulating real-world events like coin tosses. It can also be a fun way to experiment with probability and randomness.

### 2. 12_1_2 Simulate Dice Throws 🎲

This program simulates rolling a 6-sided dice multiple times using Python's `random` module. Each result represents the number displayed on the top face of the dice.
The program is designed to demonstrate randomness in dice rolls, which can be useful for games, probability studies, or testing random number generators.

### 3. 12_1_3 Generate Random Password 🔐

This program generates a random password of a specified length using only English alphabet characters. The password can contain both uppercase (`A..Z`) and lowercase (`a..z`) letters.
The program demonstrates the generation of random passwords, which can be useful for creating secure credentials or testing password generation logic.

### 4. 12_1_4 Generate Unique Lottery Numbers 🎰

This program generates 7 unique random numbers for a lottery ticket. The numbers are selected from a range of 1 to 49 and are printed in ascending order.
The program demonstrates how to generate a set of unique random numbers for lottery tickets, ensuring there are no duplicates, and the numbers are presented in an organized manner.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will gain hands-on experience using Python's `random` module to simulate real-world events, generate random values, and apply randomness in various scenarios such as security, games, and probability. These skills are foundational in working with randomness in Python.
