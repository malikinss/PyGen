# Lesson 12.3: Monte Carlo Method and Bogosort 🎲🔀

## Description 📝

This lesson introduces two interesting topics: the Monte Carlo method and the Bogosort algorithm.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to:

1. Demonstrate the Monte Carlo method through practical tasks involving numerical approximation.
2. Highlight the inefficiency of Bogosort as a contrast to realistic sorting algorithms.

## **Monte Carlo Method**

The Monte Carlo method is a group of numerical techniques that use random sampling to simulate processes and estimate parameters.
This approach is widely applied in fields like physics, finance, and statistics to solve problems that are otherwise analytically intractable.

## **Bogosort**

Bogosort is an intentionally inefficient sorting algorithm used for educational and illustrative purposes.
The algorithm works by shuffling a list randomly until the elements happen to be sorted in the desired order.
While not practical, it serves as a humorous example of a "brute force" sorting technique.

## Tasks 📜

### 1. 12_3_1 Monte Carlo Area Calculation of a Figure 🎨

This program uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the area of a geometric figure defined by a system of inequalities.
The bounding rectangle has a range of \([-2, 2]\) for both \(x\) and \(y\), and the figure satisfies the following inequalities:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&-2 \leq x \leq 2, \\
&-2 \leq y \leq 2, \\
&x^3 + y^4 + 2 \geq 0, \\
&3x + y^2 \leq 2.
\end{aligned}
\]
This task demonstrates the application of the Monte Carlo method for estimating the area of complex shapes defined by mathematical constraints.
It is a practical example of how random sampling can be used for numerical approximations.

### 2. 12_3_2 Estimate π Using Monte Carlo 🥧

This program estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method.
It generates random points within a square bounding a unit circle and calculates the ratio of points that fall inside the circle to the total number of points.
This ratio approximates the value of π.
The task demonstrates how the Monte Carlo method can be applied to approximate mathematical constants, providing a probability-based approach to numerical estimation.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will:

-   Gain a practical understanding of the Monte Carlo method and its use in estimating areas and mathematical constants.
-   Appreciate the inefficiency of Bogosort and its role as a contrast to practical algorithms.

These tasks showcase the power of randomness and probability in computational methods while also highlighting the importance of choosing the right algorithms for real-world problems.
