# Maximum Element in the Secondary Diagonal Region 📊

## Description 📝

This Python program calculates the maximum element in the region to the right of the secondary diagonal of a square matrix. The elements on the secondary diagonal are also considered as part of the region.

## Purpose 🎯

-   Identify the largest element in a specific triangular region of the matrix.
-   Gain hands-on experience with matrix operations and nested loops.
-   Useful for solving matrix-based problems in computational mathematics and algorithm design.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `get_matrix()`**:

    - Reads a square matrix of size `n x n` from user input.
    - Parses each row into integers and stores them in a list of lists.

2. **Function `find_max_in_secondary_diagonal_region()`**:

    - Iterates through the matrix, focusing on the area right of and including the secondary diagonal.
    - Compares and updates the maximum element found in the region.

3. **Function `main()`**:
    - Accepts the matrix size and matrix data from the user.
    - Calls the function to compute the maximum element in the desired region.
    - Prints the result.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the Python script `matrix_max_finder.py`.
2. Enter the matrix size (n).
3. Input the matrix row by row, space-separated.
4. The program will compute and display the maximum element in the specified region.

### Example:

```
Enter the size of the square matrix: 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 4
1 2 3 8 3
4 5 9 2 2
7 8 9 1 1
```

**Output**:  
`9`

### Explanation:

-   The secondary diagonal region (including the diagonal) consists of:

```
5
9 4
8 3 2
9 2 2 1
7 8 9 1 1
```

-   The maximum element in this region is `9`.

## Output 📜

-   A single integer representing the maximum element found in the specified region.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program offers a simple yet effective approach to matrix manipulation and diagonal-based calculations. It helps strengthen algorithmic thinking and matrix traversal techniques.
