# Lesson 3.1: Boolean Data Type 🧑‍💻

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will explore the boolean data type in Python.
I will learn about logical operators, how boolean values behave as numbers, and how to use various functions such as `bool()`, `type()`, and `isinstance()` in Python.
These concepts are essential for controlling the flow of programs based on conditions and making decisions using logical values.

## Purpose 🎯

-   **Understanding Boolean Data Type**: Learn how boolean values (`True` and `False`) are used to represent logical states.
-   **Logical Operators**: Practice using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to evaluate conditions.
-   **Boolean Values as Numbers**: Understand how `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in arithmetic operations.
-   **Built-in Functions**: Learn to use `bool()`, `type()`, and `isinstance()` to work with boolean values and data types in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will implement a program that uses boolean logic to check divisibility between two numbers.
I will get to practice:

-   Using logical comparisons (e.g., checking divisibility).
-   Understanding boolean values and their application in conditions.
-   Using the `bool()` function to convert values to booleans and examining their types.

## Task 📜

### 3_1_1 Divisibility Checker Program 🔢

This Python program defines a function that checks whether one natural number is evenly divisible by another.
The program will:

1. Accept two numbers as input.
2. Check if the first number is divisible by the second number without a remainder.
3. Print `"divided"` if the first number is divisible by the second, or `"not divided"` if it's not.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program and input two natural numbers when prompted.
2. The program will output whether the first number is divisible by the second.

### Example Usage:

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Output: divided

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3
Output: not divided
```

## Conclusion 🚀

In this lesson, I learned about the boolean data type and its operations.
I implemented a program to check divisibility using boolean logic, and practiced using logical operators and functions such as `bool()`, `type()`, and `isinstance()`.
These are foundational concepts for making decisions in Python and controlling the flow of my programs.
I'll keep practicing to solidify my understanding of boolean logic and its applications in programming! 🚀
