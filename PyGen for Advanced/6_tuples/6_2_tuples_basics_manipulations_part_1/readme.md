# Lesson 6.2: Tuples basics manipulations (Part 1) üîó

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I explore tuples, one of the fundamental data types in Python.
Tuples are immutable sequences, which makes them distinct from lists.
This lesson covers:

-   Creating and manipulating tuples.
-   Common tuple operations such as slicing, counting elements, and finding the index of an element.
-   Working with nested tuples and modifying tuple contents.

## Purpose üéØ

This lesson aims to:

-   Teach the basics of tuple creation and manipulation.
-   Provide tools for extracting and modifying elements within tuples.
-   Explore the unique features of tuples, including immutability and efficient storage.

## How It Works üîç

The lesson includes a series of programs demonstrating how to work with tuples:

1. **Get the Last Country from a Tuple**: Retrieve the last element of a tuple using negative indexing.
2. **Get the First N Elements**: Use slicing to extract the first `n` elements from a tuple.
3. **Get Elements Except the First Two**: Slice the tuple to exclude the first two elements.
4. **Get Elements Except the Last Three**: Slice the tuple to exclude the last three elements.
5. **Get Elements Except First Three and Last Two**: Slice the tuple to exclude both the first three and the last two elements.
6. **Count Elements in a Tuple**: Use the `len()` function to count the number of elements in a tuple.
7. **Sum of Minimum and Maximum Elements**: Find the sum of the minimum and maximum values in a tuple.
8. **Find Country Index**: Locate the index of a specified country in a tuple.
9. **Count Country Occurrences**: Count how many times a specific country appears in a tuple using the `count()` method.
10. **Generate Tuple**: Create a tuple by concatenating and repeating predefined tuples.
11. **Get City Info**: Store and return city name and foundation year as a tuple.
12. **Filter Non-Empty Tuples**: Filter out empty tuples from a list of tuples.
13. **Replace Last Element with 100**: Modify the last element of each tuple in a list by replacing it with `100`.

## Tasks Overview üìú

1. **6_2_1_get_last_country**: Access the last country in a tuple using negative indexing.
2. **6_2_2_get_first_n_elements**: Extract the first `n` elements from a tuple using slicing.
3. **6_2_3_get_elements_except_first_two**: Use slicing to exclude the first two elements from a tuple.
4. **6_2_4_get_elements_except_last_three**: Use slicing to exclude the last three elements from a tuple.
5. **6_2_5_get_elements_except_first_three_and_last_two**: Use slicing to exclude the first three and last two elements from a tuple.
6. **6_2_6_count_elements_in_tuple**: Count the number of elements in a tuple using `len()`.
7. **6_2_7_sum_min_max**: Find the sum of the minimum and maximum values in a tuple.
8. **6_2_8_find_country_index**: Find the index of a specified country in a tuple.
9. **6_2_9_count_country_occurrences**: Count how many times a country appears in a tuple using `count()`.
10. **6_2_10_generate_tuple**: Generate a tuple using concatenation and multiplication operators.
11. **6_2_11_get_city_info**: Store city name and foundation year in a tuple.
12. **6_2_12_filter_non_empty_tuples**: Filter out empty tuples from a list of tuples.
13. **6_2_13_replace_last_element_with_100**: Modify the last element of each tuple in a list.

## Usage üì¶

1. Run each program and follow the prompts to input the necessary data.
2. Experiment with different tuples and apply slicing, counting, and other operations to deepen my understanding of tuples.
3. Use these techniques in my projects when dealing with immutable data or when I need an efficient way to store and access elements.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson equips me with a solid understanding of tuples in Python.
I have learned how to create, manipulate, and extract data from tuples efficiently.
These skills are essential for working with immutable sequences in Python and can be applied in various fields like data analysis, algorithms, and more.
Enjoy exploring tuples further in my projects!
