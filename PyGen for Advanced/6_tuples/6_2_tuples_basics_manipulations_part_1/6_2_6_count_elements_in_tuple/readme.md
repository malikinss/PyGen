# Count the Number of Elements in a Tuple 🔢

## Description 📝

This program calculates the number of elements in a tuple using the built-in `len()` function.
The function `count_elements_in_tuple` returns the count of elements in the provided tuple.

## Purpose 🎯

-   To count the number of elements in a given tuple.
-   Demonstrates the use of the `len()` function for tuples.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `count_elements_in_tuple(tup: Tuple[str, ...])`**:

    - Takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
    - Uses `len(tup)` to count the number of elements in the tuple.
    - Returns the length of the tuple.

2. **Tuple `countries`**:

    - Contains a sequence of country names.

3. **The result**:
    - The function is called to count the elements in the tuple, and the result is printed.

### Example:

```
Input: Tuple of country names
Output: The total count of elements in the tuple
```

## Output 📜

The output will be:

```
7
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This code successfully demonstrates how to count the number of elements in a tuple using Python's built-in `len()` function, which is simple and efficient for such tasks.
