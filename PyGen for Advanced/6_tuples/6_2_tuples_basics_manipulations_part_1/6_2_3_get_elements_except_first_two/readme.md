# Get Elements Except the First Two from a Tuple 🔄

## Description 📝

This program demonstrates how to extract all elements from a tuple except for the first two using Python's slicing feature. The function `get_elements_except_first_two` returns a tuple containing all the elements except the first two.

## Purpose 🎯

-   To retrieve all elements from a tuple except the first two using slicing.
-   Showcase how to use Python slicing to omit specific elements from a tuple.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `get_elements_except_first_two(tup: Tuple[str, ...])`**:

    - Takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
    - Uses slicing (`tup[2:]`) to get all elements starting from the third element (index 2).
    - Returns the sliced tuple containing the elements except the first two.

2. **Tuple `countries`**:

    - Contains a sequence of country names.

3. **The result**:
    - The function is called to retrieve all the countries except the first two, which is then printed.

### Example:

```
Input: Tuple of country names
Output: All countries except the first two
```

## Output 📜

The output will be:

```
('Slovakia', 'Canada', 'Slovenia', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Ukraine', 'Chile', 'Cameroon')
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This code demonstrates how to use Python slicing to skip the first two elements of a tuple and return the rest, providing an efficient and concise way to manipulate tuples.
