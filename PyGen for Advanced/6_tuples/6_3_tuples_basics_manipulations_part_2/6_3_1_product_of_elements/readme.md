# Product of Elements in Tuple 📜

## Description 📝

This program calculates and prints the product of all elements in a tuple.
It takes a tuple of integers as input and returns the product of those integers.

## Purpose 🎯

-   To demonstrate how to iterate over a tuple and multiply all its elements.
-   To showcase basic operations with tuples and how to handle multiplication for multiple values.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `product_of_elements(numbers: Tuple[int, ...])`**:

    - Takes a tuple of integers as input.
    - Initializes a `result` variable to `1`.
    - Iterates through each element in the tuple and multiplies it with the `result`.
    - Returns the final product of all the numbers.

2. **List `numbers`**:

    - Contains several integers, including positive, negative, and large values.

3. **The result**:
    - The function will calculate and print the product of all the numbers in the tuple.

### Example:

```
Input: (2, 3, 5, 7, -11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, -6, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, -96, 71, 1000, -1)
Output: -18521780480400000
```

## Output 📜

The output will be:

```
-18521780480400000
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The code calculates the product of all integers in the tuple, including handling negative and large numbers correctly, and prints the result.
