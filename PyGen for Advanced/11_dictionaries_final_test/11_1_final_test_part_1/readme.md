# Lesson 11.1 Dictionaries Final Test Part 1 📚

## Description 📝

This lesson consists of 2 practical tasks and 13 theoretical questions presented on the Stepik platform. The practical tasks focus on filtering dictionary values and sorting email addresses. The goal is to help me solidify my understanding of working with dictionaries, filtering data, and manipulating strings.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to provide hands-on experience in filtering data within dictionaries and performing operations on email addresses, such as sorting and printing them in a specific format. These skills are essential when working with large datasets and when I need to clean or process information.
