# Chapter 11: Dictionaries Final Test 📚

This chapter serves as the final test for the **Dictionaries** theme in Python.
It contains 9 practical tasks and 13 theoretical questions designed to assess my understanding of dictionary operations, string manipulation, and basic algorithms.

## Description 📝

This chapter is divided into two parts:

-   **11_1_final_test_part_1** – This part includes 2 practical tasks and 13 theoretical questions. The practical tasks focus on filtering dictionary values and sorting email addresses, designed to help solidify my understanding of dictionary operations and string manipulation.
-   **11_2_final_test_part_2** – This part includes 7 practical tasks focused on solving problems related to DNA to RNA conversion, counting word occurrences, building query strings, and processing sales records.
    These tasks provide hands-on experience with dictionaries, strings, file handling, and basic algorithms.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this chapter is to:

-   Provide hands-on experience in working with dictionaries, filtering data, and performing string manipulations.
-   Test my skills in solving real-world problems such as sorting email addresses, handling sales data, merging dictionaries, and processing DNA sequences.
-   Enhance my problem-solving abilities with practical challenges involving dictionaries, strings, and file handling.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Start with 11_1_final_test_part_1**, which covers practical tasks on filtering dictionary values and sorting email addresses. It also includes theoretical questions that test my understanding of dictionary operations.
2. **Proceed to 11_2_final_test_part_2**, which includes more complex practical tasks such as processing DNA sequences, building query strings, handling access rights, and summarizing sales data.

## Output 📜

By completing this chapter, I will:

-   Strengthen my understanding of Python dictionaries and string manipulation.
-   Gain practical experience in handling real-world data and solving algorithmic problems.
-   Be prepared for future challenges involving data manipulation and file handling in Python.

## Usage 📦

1. Complete the tasks in **11_1_final_test_part_1**, focusing on dictionary filtering, sorting email addresses, and answering theoretical questions.
2. Continue to **11_2_final_test_part_2** for advanced tasks involving string manipulations, data processing, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Conclusion 🚀

This chapter serves as the culmination of my learning on Python dictionaries. By completing the tasks, I will demonstrate my ability to handle real-world data and complex problems, preparing me for more advanced data manipulation and algorithmic challenges in Python.
