# DNA to RNA Converter 🧬➡️🧪

## Description 📝

This program takes a DNA sequence as input and converts it into the corresponding RNA sequence by replacing each nucleotide with its complementary RNA nucleotide.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to convert a given DNA sequence into its RNA equivalent. The RNA sequence is generated by applying specific complementary rules for the nucleotides.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**:
    - The program prompts the user to enter a DNA sequence, which is a string of characters where each character represents a nucleotide.
2. **Processing**:
    - The program uses a mapping of DNA nucleotides to their corresponding RNA nucleotides.
    - It then generates the RNA sequence by replacing each DNA nucleotide with its RNA complement:
        - `G → C`
        - `C → G`
        - `T → A`
        - `A → U`
3. **Output**:
    - The RNA sequence is printed as a string.

## Output 📜

The program outputs the RNA sequence corresponding to the given DNA sequence.

### Example Input/Output:

**Input**:

```text
Enter the DNA sequence: GATC
```

**Output**:

```text
CUAG
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a valid DNA sequence when prompted.
3. The program will output the corresponding RNA sequence.

### Example Run:

```python
Enter the DNA sequence: GATC
CUAG
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how DNA sequences are converted into RNA sequences by applying the rules of nucleotide complementarity.
It can be used for educational purposes or as part of a larger bioinformatics tool.
