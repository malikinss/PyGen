# Lesson 11.2: Dictionaries Final Test Part 2 📚

## Description 📝

This lesson is part of the final test for dictionaries and consists of 7 practical tasks that will help solidify my understanding of working with dictionaries, strings, files, and basic algorithms.
The tasks cover various areas, such as DNA to RNA conversion, counting word occurrences, building query strings, and processing sales records.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to provide hands-on experience in solving practical problems using dictionaries, strings, and file handling.
I'll practice merging dictionaries, calculating scores, handling access rights, and summarizing sales data.
These tasks will deepen my understanding of Python and prepare me for real-world data manipulation challenges.

## Tasks 📜

### 1. 11_2_1 DNA to RNA Converter 🧬➡️🧪

This program takes a DNA sequence as input and converts it into the corresponding RNA sequence by replacing each nucleotide with its complementary RNA nucleotide.
The purpose of this program is to convert a given DNA sequence into its RNA equivalent. The RNA sequence is generated by applying specific complementary rules for the nucleotides.

### 2. 11_2_2 Count Word Occurrences 📝

This program counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given line of text. It returns a list where each entry corresponds to the number of times a word has appeared in the text up to that point.
The purpose of this program is to count the occurrences of each word in a string of text and to display a sequence of counts where each count corresponds to the number of times the respective word has appeared so far.

### 3. 11_2_3 Calculate Scrabble Score 📝

This program calculates the total Scrabble score for a given word. Each letter in the word has a specific point value, and the total score is the sum of the points of each letter.
The purpose of this program is to calculate the total value of a word in Scrabble based on the individual point values assigned to each letter.

### 4. 11_2_4 Build Query String 📝

This program takes a dictionary of query parameters and returns a properly formatted query string that can be appended to a URL. The query string is generated in lexicographic order of the dictionary keys.
The purpose of this program is to build a query string for URLs from a given dictionary, ensuring the parameters are sorted in lexicographic order and formatted correctly.

### 5. 11_2_5 Merge 📝

This program merges multiple dictionaries into a single dictionary. Each key in the resulting dictionary contains a set of unique values collected from all the dictionaries in the provided list. The merging process ensures that each value under a key is unique, eliminating duplicates.
The purpose of this program is to merge a list of dictionaries such that each key in the resulting dictionary holds a set of unique values, gathered from all input dictionaries.

### 6. 11_2_6 Try to Work with Files 📝

This program restores file access rights control after a virus has broken the system. The program verifies user requests to perform actions (Read, Write, or Execute) on files, ensuring that only allowed actions are executed based on the file’s access rights. For each request, the program returns either `OK` if the action is allowed or `Access denied` if it is not.
The purpose of this program is to simulate file access rights control in a file system, allowing the verification of user actions (Read, Write, Execute) on files based on their assigned access rights.

### 7. 11_2_7 Process Sales 📝

This program processes a list of sales records from an online store and generates a sales summary. It counts the number of units of each product purchased by each customer and outputs the summary in lexicographic order by customer and product names.
The purpose of this program is to track the products purchased by customers, count the number of units purchased, and display a sales summary in lexicographic order.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will have honed my skills in working with dictionaries, manipulating strings, and processing files.
I will also have learned how to work with real-world data, such as sales records and DNA sequences, and how to solve common problems related to these tasks.
