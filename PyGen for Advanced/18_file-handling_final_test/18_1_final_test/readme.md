# Lesson 18.1: File Handling Final Test 📝

## Description 🎯

This lesson is focused on testing various file handling techniques in Python.
It covers practical tasks that involve reading from, writing to, and modifying files.
I will work with text files to perform operations like counting lines, calculating revenue, finding the longest words, and more.

## Tasks 📝

The lesson includes 8 practical tasks that are designed to test the file handling skills:

1. **Count Lines in File**

    - A program that counts the number of lines in a text file.

2. **Calculate Total Revenue**

    - A program that calculates the total revenue for a company based on sales data stored in a text file.

3. **Count Students with All Tests Good**

    - A program that analyzes student scores and counts how many students have passed all tests.

4. **Find Longest Words**

    - A program that finds the longest words in a text file without changing their order.

5. **Display Last Lines**

    - A program that displays the last 10 lines of a file or the entire file if it contains fewer than 10 lines.

6. **Replace Forbidden Words in File**

    - A program that replaces forbidden words with asterisks, based on a list of forbidden words stored in a separate file.

7. **Process Transliteration**

    - A program that reads Cyrillic text and transliterates it to Latin characters, saving the result to a new file.

8. **Find Functions Without Comments**
    - A program that identifies Python functions that lack explanatory comments and outputs their names.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to apply the file handling concepts learned throughout the course to solve real-world problems using Python.
It covers working with files for tasks such as filtering content, extracting information, and performing file manipulations.

## How It Works 🔍

The program uses various file handling techniques:

-   **Reading** files to extract content.
-   **Writing** to files to store results or modify existing content.
-   **Processing data** by performing tasks such as counting, replacing, and calculating.

## Output 📜

The output varies depending on the task:

-   Counts, total revenues, and lists of functions are displayed or saved to files.
-   Data is modified or processed according to the specifications of each task.

## Usage 📦

1. Download or open the provided file for the respective task.
2. Follow the instructions in the task to implement the solution.
3. Run the program to test file handling operations.
4. Verify the output by checking the contents of the result files or the displayed output.

## Conclusion 🚀

The final test challenges me to apply the knowledge gained throughout the lesson.
Successfully completing the tasks demonstrates proficiency in file handling with Python and prepares me for further work involving text files.
