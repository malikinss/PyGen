TODO:
    Implement a function get_weekday() that takes one argument:
        number â€” an integer (from 1 to 7 inclusive)

    The function should return the full name of the day of the week in Russian
    that corresponds to the number, and:
        - If number is not an integer, the function should raise an exception:
            TypeError('The argument is not an integer')

        - If number is an integer but does not belong to the segment [1;7],
        the function should raise an exception:
            ValueError('The argument does not belong to the required range')
