# add_to_list_in_dict Function

## Description 📝

This program defines the `add_to_list_in_dict()` function that modifies a dictionary of lists.
It adds an element to the list at the specified key in the dictionary.
If the key is not already present in the dictionary, the function creates a new key with an empty list and then adds the element.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this function is to simplify the process of adding elements to lists within a dictionary.
It ensures that the dictionary's structure is always preserved and that lists are properly initialized if necessary.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function takes three parameters:

    - `data`: A dictionary where values are lists.
    - `key`: A hashable object (such as a string or integer) that identifies the key in the dictionary.
    - `element`: The element to add to the list.

2. The function attempts to access the list at the specified key. If the key doesn't exist, a `KeyError` is raised, and an empty list is created for that key.

3. The element is then appended to the list corresponding to the key.

## Output 📜

The function modifies the dictionary in place and does not return any value.

## Usage 📦

1. Define a dictionary `data` where the values are lists.
2. Call the `add_to_list_in_dict()` function, passing the dictionary, the key, and the element to be added.

Example:

```python
data = {}
add_to_list_in_dict(data, 'fruits', 'apple')
add_to_list_in_dict(data, 'fruits', 'banana')
print(data)
```

````

Output:

```python
{'fruits': ['apple', 'banana']}
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `add_to_list_in_dict()` function is a useful utility for managing dictionary-based collections where values are lists.
It ensures that elements are added in a way that maintains the integrity of the dictionary structure.
