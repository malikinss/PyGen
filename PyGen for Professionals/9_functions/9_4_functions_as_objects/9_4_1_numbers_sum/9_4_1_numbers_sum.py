TODO:
    Implement a numbers_sum() function that takes one argument:
        elems â€” a list of arbitrary objects

    The function should return the sum of the numbers (int and float types)
    in the elems list, ignoring any non-numeric objects.

    If there are no numbers in the elems list, the function should return
    the number 0.

    The function should also have the following docstring:
        Take a list and return the sum of its numbers (int, float),
        ignoring non-numeric objects.
        0 - if there are no numbers in the list.
