1. 9_1_built_in_functions_part_1

```
# Lesson 9.1: Built-in Functions (part 1) ðŸ” 
This lesson explores **built-in functions** in Python, focusing on **mathematical operations** and **functions that work with collections**.
Python provides a vast number of built-in functions that simplify coding tasks and enhance program efficiency.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
âœ… Learn how to use key built-in functions for working with numbers, collections, and sorting.
âœ… Implement **11 practical tasks** that strengthen my understanding of built-in functions.
âœ… Answer **3 theoretical questions** to deepen my comprehension.
```

2. 9_2_built_in_functions_part_2

```
# Lesson 9.2: Built-in Functions part 2 ðŸ”§
This lesson focuses on **useful built-in functions** in Python, specifically functions like `callable()`, `hasattr()`, `help()`, `repr()`, `hash()`, `eval()`, and `exec()`.
These functions are key tools for checking attributes, evaluating expressions, debugging, and interacting with Python objects and the runtime environment.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   Understand how to use **`callable()`** and **`hasattr()`** to interact with functions and objects.
-   Learn how to utilize **`help()`** and **`repr()`** for debugging and providing better object representations.
-   Be able to apply **`hash()`** to manage hashable objects in data structures.
-   Use **`eval()`** and **`exec()`** to dynamically evaluate expressions and execute Python code.
```

3. 9_3_anonymous_functions_map_filter

```
# Lesson 9.3: Anonymous Functions, Map(), Filter() Functions ðŸ”§
This lesson focuses on **anonymous functions** (lambda functions) and higher-order functions **`map()`** and **`filter()`**, which we previously encountered in the course.
These functions allow for cleaner and more functional code when manipulating and transforming data.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   Be able to use **anonymous functions (lambda functions)** for concise function definitions.
-   Understand how to apply **`map()`** and **`filter()`** functions to manipulate and filter data in Python.
-   Learn to combine **`map()`** and **`filter()`** with **lambda functions** to write more efficient and functional code.
