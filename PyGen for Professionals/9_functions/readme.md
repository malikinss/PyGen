1. 9_1_built_in_functions_part_1

```
# Lesson 9.1: Built-in Functions (part 1) 🔠
This lesson explores **built-in functions** in Python, focusing on **mathematical operations** and **functions that work with collections**.
Python provides a vast number of built-in functions that simplify coding tasks and enhance program efficiency.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn how to use key built-in functions for working with numbers, collections, and sorting.
✅ Implement **11 practical tasks** that strengthen my understanding of built-in functions.
✅ Answer **3 theoretical questions** to deepen my comprehension.
```

2. 9_2_built_in_functions_part_2

```
# Lesson 9.2: Built-in Functions part 2 🔧
This lesson focuses on **useful built-in functions** in Python, specifically functions like `callable()`, `hasattr()`, `help()`, `repr()`, `hash()`, `eval()`, and `exec()`.
These functions are key tools for checking attributes, evaluating expressions, debugging, and interacting with Python objects and the runtime environment.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   Understand how to use **`callable()`** and **`hasattr()`** to interact with functions and objects.
-   Learn how to utilize **`help()`** and **`repr()`** for debugging and providing better object representations.
-   Be able to apply **`hash()`** to manage hashable objects in data structures.
-   Use **`eval()`** and **`exec()`** to dynamically evaluate expressions and execute Python code.
```

3. 9_3_anonymous_functions_map_filter

```
# Lesson 9.3: Anonymous Functions, Map(), Filter() Functions 🔧
This lesson focuses on **anonymous functions** (lambda functions) and higher-order functions **`map()`** and **`filter()`**, which we previously encountered in the course.
These functions allow for cleaner and more functional code when manipulating and transforming data.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
-   Be able to use **anonymous functions (lambda functions)** for concise function definitions.
-   Understand how to apply **`map()`** and **`filter()`** functions to manipulate and filter data in Python.
-   Learn to combine **`map()`** and **`filter()`** with **lambda functions** to write more efficient and functional code.
```

4. 9_4_functions_as_objects

```
# Lesson 9.4: Functions as Objects 🏗️
This lesson explores **functions as objects** in Python, demonstrating that functions can have attributes and be manipulated just like any other object.
Python functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and modified dynamically.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand that **functions are objects** and can have attributes.
✅ Learn how to access function attributes like **`__name__`**, **`__doc__`**, and **`__defaults__`**.
✅ Modify function behavior dynamically by assigning attributes or overriding built-in functions.
```

5. 9_5_nested_functions_closures

```
# Lesson 9.5: Nested Functions, Closures 🏗️
This lesson covers **nested functions** and **closures** in Python.
It explains how an inner function can access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.
It also introduces the `nonlocal` keyword and the `closure` attribute, crucial for understanding how variables from outer functions persist in inner functions.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand the concept of **nested functions** and how they work.
✅ Learn about **closures** and how an inner function can remember and access variables from its enclosing scope.
✅ Understand the use of the **`nonlocal`** keyword to modify variables in an outer but non-global scope.
✅ Implement practical use cases such as **function generators** and **URL query string builders**.
