# Lesson 9.6: Type Annotations üìù

## Description üìù

This lesson explores **type annotations** in Python, providing insights into how the Python typing system works and how to apply type hints to enhance code readability, maintainability, and error detection.
It covers the basic principles of **typing in programming languages** and explains the use of the **Typing module** in Python, introducing various types and how they can be applied in different scenarios.

## Purpose üéØ

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Understand the role of **type annotations** in Python and how they help define variable and function types.  
‚úÖ Learn how to use the **Typing module** and various **useful types** provided by it, such as `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Any`, and more.  
‚úÖ Apply type annotations to practical programming tasks to make code more predictable and robust.

## How It Works üîç

This lesson covers the following key topics:

1. **Typing of Programming Languages**: The concept of typing in programming languages, its importance, and how Python introduces dynamic typing.
2. **Type Annotations**: How to use type hints to define the expected data types of function arguments and return values.
3. **Typing Module**: Introduction to Python‚Äôs `typing` module, which includes a variety of types and tools for annotating Python code.
4. **Useful Types of the Typing Module**: Explanation of commonly used types from the `typing` module such as `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, and `Any`.

The lesson includes 4 programming tasks that demonstrate the practical application of **type annotations**:

1.  **9_6_1_get_digits**

**Goal**: Implement the `get_digits()` function that extracts the digits from a positive integer or float and returns them as a list of integers.

-   The task will involve adding type annotations for the function argument and return type.

2.  **9_6_2_top_grade**

**Goal**: Define the `top_grade()` function, which calculates the highest grade for each student from a dictionary containing student names and their grades.

-   This will demonstrate how to annotate functions that work with dictionaries and lists.

3.  **9_6_3_cyclic_shift**

**Goal**: Write the `cyclic_shift()` function, which cyclically shifts elements of a list.

-   This task will require annotating the function that takes a list and an integer as arguments and modifies the list in place.

4.  **9_6_4_matrix_to_dict**

**Goal**: Create the `matrix_to_dict()` function that converts a matrix (2D list) into a dictionary with row indices as keys.

-   This will involve using `Dict` and `List` types from the `typing` module to represent the matrix and dictionary structures.

## Output üìú

After completing this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Understand how to add **type annotations** to function arguments and return values to make my code more readable and maintainable.  
‚úÖ Be familiar with the **Typing module** and its useful types such as `List`, `Dict`, and `Tuple`.  
‚úÖ Be able to apply **type hints** in practical tasks, improving code quality and reducing errors during development.

## Conclusion üöÄ

Type annotations play an essential role in Python, helping developers understand the expected data types of function arguments and return values.
By mastering the use of type hints and the **Typing module**, I can write clearer, more robust, and maintainable code.
This lesson‚Äôs practical tasks will help solidify my understanding and enhance my ability to apply type annotations effectively in real-world Python applications.
