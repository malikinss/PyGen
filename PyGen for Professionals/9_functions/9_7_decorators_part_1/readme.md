# Lesson 9.7: Decorators (part 1) üìù

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I delve into **decorators** in Python, a powerful and flexible tool for modifying the behavior of functions or methods.
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, wraps it with additional functionality, and returns it.
I will explore various types of decorators, including those that add behavior before and after a function call, change the function‚Äôs arguments, and handle exceptions.

## Purpose üéØ

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Understand the concept and syntax of **decorators** in Python.  
‚úÖ Learn how to define and apply decorators to modify the behavior of functions.  
‚úÖ Explore how to use multiple decorators on a single function.  
‚úÖ Work with decorators that take arguments and return values.  
‚úÖ Learn how to handle exceptions using decorators and validate input before function execution.

## How It Works üîç

This lesson covers the following key topics:

1. **Defining a Decorator**: The basic structure of a decorator, how it accepts a function as an argument and returns a modified version of it.
2. **Special Syntax for Using Decorators**: The use of the `@decorator` syntax to apply decorators to functions.
3. **Changing Function Behavior**: Modifying a function‚Äôs behavior before and after its execution.
4. **Using Multiple Decorators**: Applying more than one decorator to a function and understanding the order of execution.
5. **Decorating Functions that Take Arguments**: Handling functions that accept parameters and modifying them using decorators.
6. **Returning Values from a Decorated Function**: Ensuring the decorated function returns appropriate values after modification.

The lesson includes 6 practical tasks that demonstrate the use of decorators:

1.  **9_7_1_sandwich**

**Goal**: Implement a `sandwich` decorator that adds "bread slices" before and after the decorated function.

-   This task teaches how to decorate functions and add behavior before and after their execution without altering their return value.

2.  **9_7_2_upper_print**

**Goal**: Create a `upper_print` decorator that modifies the behavior of the `print()` function to print all text in uppercase.

-   This task shows how to override built-in functions using decorators and modify their behavior while keeping the original function's signature.

3.  **9_7_3_do_twice**

**Goal**: Write a `do_twice` decorator that calls the decorated function twice.

-   This teaches how to repeat function calls without changing the function's return value or parameters.

4.  **9_7_4_reverse_args**

**Goal**: Define a `reverse_args` decorator that reverses the order of positional arguments passed to a function.

-   This task demonstrates how to modify the arguments of a function before passing them, allowing me to change the order of input.

5.  **9_7_5_exception_decorator**

**Goal**: Implement an `exception_decorator` that handles exceptions gracefully and returns a message indicating success or failure.

-   This teaches how to wrap functions with a decorator that handles errors and returns appropriate status messages.

6.  **9_7_6_takes_positive**

**Goal**: Create a `takes_positive` decorator that validates whether all arguments passed to a function are positive integers.

-   This task shows how to validate inputs before executing the function, ensuring only valid data is processed.

## Output üìú

After completing this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Understand how decorators work and how to define them.  
‚úÖ Be able to apply decorators to functions to modify their behavior, handle exceptions, and validate inputs.  
‚úÖ Learn how to use multiple decorators and understand how they interact.  
‚úÖ Have a deeper understanding of **function wrapping** and how decorators can enhance code readability and functionality.

## Conclusion üöÄ

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow me to modify the behavior of functions in a clean and reusable way.
This lesson provides a solid foundation in understanding decorators, from basic usage to handling more complex scenarios such as error handling and input validation.
By mastering decorators, I will be able to write more modular, maintainable, and flexible code.
