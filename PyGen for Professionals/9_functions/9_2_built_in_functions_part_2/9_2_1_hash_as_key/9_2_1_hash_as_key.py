TODO:
        Implement a hash_as_key() function that takes one argument:
            objects â€” a list of objects to hash

        The function should return a dictionary whose key is the hash value of
        an object in the objects list, and whose value is the object itself.

        If some objects have the same hash value, they should be combined
        into a list.

NOTE:
        The elements in the dictionary returned by the function, as well as
        the objects in the list that have equal hash values, should be in
        their original order.
