# Lesson 9.8: Decorators (part 2) üìù

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I explore more advanced aspects of **decorators** in Python.
I will cover how to use the `functools.wraps` decorator to preserve the name and docstring of a decorated function, how to create general-purpose decorators, and various practical use cases.
These include decorators for measuring execution time, tracking function calls, modifying return values, and handling exceptions.
I will also learn how to create decorators that accept arguments, providing more flexibility for customizing function behavior.

## Purpose üéØ

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Learn to use **`functools.wraps`** to preserve function metadata.  
‚úÖ Understand how to create general-purpose decorators.  
‚úÖ Create a decorator that measures function execution time.  
‚úÖ Track the number of times a function is called using a decorator.  
‚úÖ Implement a decorator that intentionally slows down a function‚Äôs execution.  
‚úÖ Work with decorators that accept arguments for more control over function behavior.  
‚úÖ Explore advanced decorators for handling exceptions and retrying failed executions.

## How It Works üîç

This lesson covers the following advanced decorator topics:

1. **Preserving Function Metadata**: Using `functools.wraps` to maintain a decorated function‚Äôs original name, docstring, and other metadata.
2. **General-Purpose Decorators**: How to write decorators that can be used across different functions for tasks like timing execution, counting function calls, etc.
3. **Measuring Function Execution Time**: Creating a decorator that tracks how long a function takes to execute, which can be useful for performance profiling.
4. **Tracking Function Calls**: A decorator that counts how many times a function is called, providing insight into its usage.
5. **Slowing Down Function Execution**: A decorator that deliberately delays a function‚Äôs execution, useful for testing or simulating slow environments.
6. **Decorators with Arguments**: How to pass arguments to decorators to provide additional flexibility and customization.
7. **Exception Handling and Retrying**: Implementing decorators that catch exceptions and retry failed function executions a specified number of times.

The lesson includes 12 practical tasks to reinforce these concepts:

1.  **9_8_1_square**

**Goal**: Implement a `square` decorator that squares the return value of the function.

-   Use `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's name and docstring.

2.  **9_8_2_returns_string**

**Goal**: Implement a `returns_string` decorator that ensures the function‚Äôs return value is always a string, raising an exception if it is not.

3.  **9_8_3_trace**

**Goal**: Create a `trace` decorator that prints the function‚Äôs name, arguments, and return value for debugging purposes.

4.  **9_8_4_prefix**

**Goal**: Implement a `prefix` decorator that adds a prefix to the return value of the function.

5.  **9_8_5_make_html**

**Goal**: Write a `make_html()` decorator that wraps the return value of a function in an HTML tag.

6.  **9_8_6_repeat**

**Goal**: Create a `repeat()` decorator that repeats the function‚Äôs execution a specified number of times.

7.  **9_8_7_strip_range**

**Goal**: Implement a `strip_range()` decorator that replaces a specific range of characters in the return string with a specified character.

8.  **9_8_8_returns**

**Goal**: Create a `returns()` decorator that checks the function‚Äôs return type, raising a `TypeError` if the type does not match the expected one.

9.  **9_8_9_takes**

**Goal**: Write a `takes()` decorator that ensures the function‚Äôs arguments are of the correct types, raising a `TypeError` for invalid argument types.

10. **9_8_10_add_attrs**

**Goal**: Implement an `add_attrs` decorator that adds arbitrary named attributes to the function.

11. **9_8_11_ignore_exception**

**Goal**: Create an `ignore_exception` decorator that handles specific exceptions and continues function execution without interruption.

12. **9_8_12_retry**

**Goal**: Write a `retry` decorator that retries the function execution up to a specified number of times if an exception occurs.

## Output üìú

After completing this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Be proficient in creating general-purpose decorators that handle a wide range of scenarios, including performance tracking, type checking, and retry logic.  
‚úÖ Understand how to use `functools.wraps` to preserve the metadata of the decorated functions.  
‚úÖ Be able to create custom decorators with arguments for more flexible behavior.  
‚úÖ Gain experience in advanced decorator use cases such as exception handling and timing function execution.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson provides an in-depth exploration of decorators and how they can be used to enhance function behavior in Python.
By mastering these concepts, I will be able to write more flexible, maintainable, and powerful code that can be reused across multiple projects.
Decorators are a key tool in Python that allow me to keep my code clean while adding useful functionality such as logging, performance monitoring, and error handling.
