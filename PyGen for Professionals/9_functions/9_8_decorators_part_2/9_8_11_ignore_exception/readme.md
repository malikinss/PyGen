# `ignore_exception` Decorator

## Description üìù

The `ignore_exception` decorator allows you to specify multiple exception types to be handled during the execution of a decorated function.
If an exception of one of the specified types is raised, a message indicating that the exception was handled is printed.
If an exception of an unexpected type is raised, it is re-raised as usual.

## Purpose üéØ

This decorator can be useful for handling specific exceptions in a controlled manner while allowing other exceptions to propagate normally.
It is particularly useful when you want to log or manage certain exceptions without interrupting the program flow.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Input**:
    - The decorator takes an arbitrary number of exception types as arguments. These are the types of exceptions that should be caught and handled.
2. **Processing**:

    - The decorated function is wrapped inside a `try-except` block. If an exception of one of the specified types is raised, a message is printed indicating that the exception has been handled.
    - If any other exception type is raised, it is re-raised without any handling.

3. **Output**:
    - If a specified exception is raised, a message is printed, and the function returns `None`.
    - If an unexpected exception is raised, it is re-raised.

## Example üìú

```python
# Define the ignore_exception decorator
@ignore_exception(ValueError, KeyError)
def example_function(x):
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative value")
    elif x == 0:
        raise KeyError("Zero is not allowed")
    return f"Value is {x}"

# Call with different arguments
print(example_function(-1))  # Output: Exception ValueError is handled
print(example_function(0))   # Output: Exception KeyError is handled
print(example_function(5))   # Output: Value is 5
```

### Output:

```text
Exception ValueError is handled
Exception KeyError is handled
Value is 5
```

In this example, the function `example_function` raises different exceptions based on the input. The decorator handles `ValueError` and `KeyError` exceptions, printing a message indicating that they have been handled. Other exceptions would be re-raised as usual.

## Usage üì¶

1. Define the `ignore_exception` decorator in your script.
2. Apply it to any function by using the `@ignore_exception(*exceptions)` syntax, where `exceptions` is a list of exception types you want to handle.
3. Inside the decorated function, raise exceptions as usual. If one of the specified exception types is raised, the decorator will print a message instead of propagating the exception.

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `ignore_exception` decorator provides an elegant way to handle specific exceptions in your code without interrupting the program flow.
By using this decorator, you can capture and manage known exceptions in a clean manner while allowing other exceptions to behave as they normally would.
