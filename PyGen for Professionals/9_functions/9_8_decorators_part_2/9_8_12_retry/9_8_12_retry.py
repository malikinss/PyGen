TODO:
    Implement a retry decorator that takes one argument:
        times â€” a natural number

    The decorator should retry calling the decorated function if an error
    occurs during its execution.

    The decorator should call it until it exhausts the number of times, after
    which it should throw a MaxRetriesException.

    The decorator should also save the name and docstring of
    the decorated function.
NOTE:
    Remember that the decorator must not consume the return value
    of the decorated function, and must be able to decorate functions with
    an arbitrary number of positional and named arguments.
