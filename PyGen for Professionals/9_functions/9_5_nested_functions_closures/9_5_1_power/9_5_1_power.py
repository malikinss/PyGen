TODO:
        Implement a function power() that takes one argument:
            degree â€” an integer

        The function power() should return a function that takes an
        integer x as an argument and returns the value of x raised to
        the power degree.

NOTE:
        Let's look at the example from the first test.

        The call power(2) returns a function that takes a number as an
        argument and raises it to the second power.

        The function is assigned to the variable square.
        The resulting function is then called with the argument 5 and returns
        the value 5**2=25.
