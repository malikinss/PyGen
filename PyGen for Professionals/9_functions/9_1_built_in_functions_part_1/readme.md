# Lesson 9.1: Built-in Functions (part 1) 🔠

## Description 📝

This lesson explores **built-in functions** in Python, focusing on **mathematical operations** and **functions that work with collections**.
Python provides a vast number of built-in functions that simplify coding tasks and enhance program efficiency.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Learn how to use key built-in functions for working with numbers, collections, and sorting.  
✅ Implement **11 practical tasks** that strengthen my understanding of built-in functions.  
✅ Answer **3 theoretical questions** to deepen my comprehension.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson consists of **11 tasks** that cover various built-in functions:

1. **9_1_1_print_lowercase_letters** 🅰️

    - Prints all lowercase Latin letters (`a-z`) using `ord()`, `chr()`, and `string.ascii_lowercase`.

2. **9_1_2_convert** 🔢

    - Converts an integer to **binary, octal, and hexadecimal** without prefixes using `bin()`, `oct()`, and `hex()`.

3. **9_1_3_get_film_with_lowest_rating** 📝

    - Processes film ratings and identifies the movie with the **lowest average rating**.

4. **9_1_4_non_negative_even** ✔️

    - Uses `all()` to check if all numbers in a list are **even and non-negative**.

5. **9_1_5_is_greater** 🔢

    - Uses `any()` to check if the **sum of any nested list** is greater than a given number.

6. **9_1_6_custom_isinstance** 🧐

    - Counts how many objects in a list match a **specific type** using `isinstance()`.

7. **9_1_7_find_max_index** 📊

    - Finds the **index of the maximum element** in a list of integers.

8. **9_1_8_my_pow** 🧮

    - Computes the **sum of digits raised to their position** using `enumerate()` and `sum()`.

9. **9_1_9_print_profit_per_movie** 🎬

    - Calculates and prints **movie profits**, sorting them lexicographically.

10. **9_1_10_zip_longest** 🔗

-   Implements a **custom `zip_longest()` function** to handle iterables of different lengths.

11. **9_1_11_custom_sort** 🔠

-   Sorts a string with **custom rules**, ordering lowercase letters first, then uppercase, followed by numbers where **odd digits come before even digits**.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I will:  
🚀 Understand **how to apply built-in functions** effectively.  
🚀 Be able to **process collections, perform type checks, and manipulate numbers** using Python functions.  
🚀 Improve my **problem-solving skills** by working with practical coding tasks.

## Conclusion 🚀

Mastering built-in functions is crucial for writing efficient and concise Python code.
This lesson helps me leverage **Python’s built-in tools** to simplify complex tasks, optimize performance, and enhance my programming abilities.
