TODO:
    Implement a function sum_of_powers_of_digits() that takes one argument:
        number â€” a non-negative integer

    The function should return a sum consisting of the digits of the number
    raised to the power of their ordinal number.

NOTE:
    Consider the number 139 from the first test.

    The sum of the digits of this number raised to the power of their ordinal
    number is:
        1^1 + 3^2 + 9 ^ 3 = 739

    It is convenient to use the enumerate() and sum() functions in the problem.
