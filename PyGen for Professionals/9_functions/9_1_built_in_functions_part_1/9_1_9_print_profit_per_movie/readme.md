## Description üìù

This Python script calculates and prints the profit of various movies by subtracting their budget from their box office earnings.
The output is sorted lexicographically by movie name.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this program is to practice working with multiple lists, computing derived values (profits), sorting data, and using the `zip()` function.
It reinforces concepts like list comprehensions and sorting in Python.

## How It Works üîç

1. **TODO Comment**: Describes the task of computing movie profits and printing them in a sorted manner.
2. **zip() Function**: Used to pair each movie name with its budget and box office earnings.
3. **List Comprehension**: Calculates profit by subtracting the budget from the box office revenue.
4. **Sorting**: Sorts the movie list lexicographically by name.
5. **Formatted Output**: Prints each movie name followed by its profit in dollars.

## Output üìú

When the script is executed, it will output:

```
Cars: 342216280$
Coco: 627082196$
Finding Nemo: 846335536$

Moana: 493331111$
Ratatouille: 470702951$
Zootopia: 873784195$
```

## Usage üì¶

1. Save the code to a file named `movie_profit_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    ```
    python movie_profit_calculator.py
    ```
5. The program will display a list of movies along with their profits.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This program effectively demonstrates how to work with multiple related lists, calculate derived values, and sort data using Python‚Äôs built-in functions.
It highlights the usefulness of `zip()`, list comprehensions, and sorting.
