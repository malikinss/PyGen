# Chapter 2: Basic Constructions

## Description üìù

Chapter 2 delves into the **fundamental constructs of Python**, focusing on basic programming concepts that form the foundation of coding.
The chapter consists of two lessons, each containing practical tasks that will help solidify my understanding of Python's core elements.
This chapter covers a wide range of topics such as data types, conditional statements, loops, and basic data structures (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries).

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this chapter is to:

-   Review essential Python constructs like **input/output**, **data types**, **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **functions**.
-   Strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals through **practical tasks**.
-   Develop problem-solving skills by applying basic constructs in **real-world scenarios**.

## Lesson Breakdown üîç

### 2.1: Basic Constructions (Part 1) üöÄ

This lesson introduces key Python constructs through **11 practical tasks**. The main concepts covered include:

-   Data input/output
-   Data types (strings, integers, etc.)
-   Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
-   Loops (`for`, `while`)
-   Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
-   Functions

The tasks in this lesson are designed to provide a mix of simple exercises and more complex algorithmic problems that require structured solutions. Completing these tasks will strengthen my grasp of Python basics and prepare me for more advanced topics.

### 2.2: Basic Constructions (Part 2)

In this lesson, the focus is on reinforcing and deepening the knowledge of Python's basic structures. The practical tasks will enhance my ability to:

-   Work with sequences (e.g., lists, tuples)
-   Handle **duplicates** and **generate lists**
-   Calculate distances and manipulate data
-   Apply conditional statements and loops to solve problems
-   Refine my function-writing skills

By completing the exercises, I will further solidify my understanding of the most important constructs in Python, enabling me to tackle a wider variety of practical problems.

## Key Features üöÄ

-   **20 Practical Tasks**: Tasks are designed to be a mix of easy and challenging problems to help me practice the fundamentals.
-   **Hands-on Learning**: Each lesson is designed to reinforce learning through practical problem-solving.
-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Topics covered in this chapter are essential for understanding how Python works, making this chapter foundational for further studies.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of Chapter 2, I will have a solid understanding of Python's basic constructs and problem-solving techniques.
The knowledge gained here will be fundamental as I move forward in my Python journey, preparing you for more advanced topics in the course.
