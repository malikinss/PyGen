TODO:
    Implement the index_of_nearest() function, which takes two arguments in
    the following order:
        numbers â€” a list of integers
        number â€” an integer

    The function must find the number closest to the number in the numbers
    list and return its index.

    If the numbers list is empty, the function should return the number -1.

NOTE:
    If a list containing several numbers that are simultaneously closest to
    the desired number is passed to the function, the function must return the
    smallest of the indexes of the nearest numbers.
