TODO:
    Implement the same_parity() function, which takes a single argument:
        numbers â€” a list of integers

    The function should return a new list, the elements of which are numbers
    from the numbers list having the same parity as the first element of this
    list.

NOTE:
    The numbers in the list returned by the function must be in their original
    order.
