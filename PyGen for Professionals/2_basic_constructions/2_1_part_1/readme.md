# Lesson 2.1: Basic Constructions (Part 1) 🚀

## Description 🎯

This lesson introduces fundamental Python constructs through **11 practical tasks**.
It serves as a review of key programming concepts such as:

-   Data input/output
-   Data types
-   Conditional statements
-   Loops
-   Strings
-   Lists
-   Tuples
-   Sets
-   Dictionaries
-   Files
-   Functions

The tasks range from simple warm-up exercises to more complex algorithmic problems requiring deeper thought and structured solutions.

## Tasks 📝

### 1. Hide Card Number 🔐

**`hide_card()`** hides all but the last four digits of a credit card number, replacing them with asterisks (`*`).

### 2. Same Parity Filter 🔢

**`same_parity()`** filters numbers from a list to match the parity (even/odd) of the first element.

### 3. PIN Code Validator 🔑

**`is_valid()`** checks if a string meets PIN code requirements: only digits, 4-6 characters long, no spaces.

### 4. Print Arguments and Their Types 📌

**`print_given()`** prints values and their types from positional and keyword arguments.

### 5. Convert String Case 🔡

**`convert()`** converts a string to **uppercase** or **lowercase**, depending on the majority letter case.

### 6. Filter Anagrams 🔄

**`filter_anagrams()`** returns a list of words that are anagrams of the given word.

### 7. Likes System 👍

**`likes()`** generates a **social media-style** message for how many people liked a post.

### 8. Index of Nearest Number 📍

**`index_of_nearest()`** finds the index of the closest number to a given target in a list.

### 9. Spell Function 📝

**`spell()`** creates a dictionary where keys are first letters of words, and values are the longest word lengths.

### 10. Choose Plural Form 🔢

**`choose_plural()`** selects the correct plural noun form based on quantity (useful for UI and notifications).

### 11. Get Biggest Number 🔢

**`get_biggest()`** rearranges a list of numbers to form the **largest** possible number.

## Purpose 🎯

This lesson strengthens understanding of Python basics and problem-solving techniques by applying them in real-world scenarios.

## Usage 📦

1. Read the problem description for each task.
2. Implement the function based on the given requirements.
3. Run tests to verify correctness.
4. Optimize the solution where possible.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will have reinforced essential Python skills and improved my ability to **analyze problems** and **write efficient code**.
