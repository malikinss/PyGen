# Find Maximum Group Length Function

## Description 📝

The `find_max_group_length()` function groups numbers from 1 to a given number `n` by the sum of their digits and determines the length of the group containing the largest number of numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

This function is useful for:

-   Grouping numbers in a sequence by the sum of their digits.
-   Identifying the group with the largest number of numbers and determining its length.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function calculates the sum of digits for each number in the sequence from 1 to `n`.
2. It groups the numbers based on the calculated sum of digits.
3. It then finds the group that has the maximum number of elements and returns its length.

## Output 📜

Example usage and expected outputs:

```python
find_max_group_length(20)
# Input: 20
# Output: 3
```

In the sequence from 1 to 20, the numbers are grouped by the sum of their digits as follows:

```
(1, 10), (2, 11, 20), (3, 12), (4, 13), (5, 14),
(6, 15), (7, 16), (8, 17), (9, 18), (19)
```

The largest group has a length of 3, which is the output.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use the function in your script or interactive Python shell.

Example:

```python
from group_numbers import find_max_group_length

n = 20
max_group_length = find_max_group_length(n)
print(max_group_length)  # Output: 3
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `find_max_group_length()` function provides a way to analyze sequences of numbers by the sum of their digits, efficiently finding the largest group and returning its length.
It's useful for sorting and categorizing numbers based on their digit sums.
