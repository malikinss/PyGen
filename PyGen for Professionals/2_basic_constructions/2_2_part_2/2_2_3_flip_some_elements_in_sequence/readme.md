# Flip Some Elements in Sequence Function

## Description 📝

The `flip_some_elements_in_sequence()` function manipulates a sequence of natural numbers by flipping specific segments.
The program takes the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` and flips two segments specified by indices `X` to `Y` and `A` to `B`, where the indices are 1-based.

## Purpose 🎯

This function is useful for:

-   Reversing portions of a sequence based on provided indices.
-   Performing list manipulation tasks where specific segments of a list need to be reversed.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function generates a sequence of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It then flips two segments of this sequence:
    - The first segment is from index `X` to `Y`.
    - The second segment is from index `A` to `B`.
3. The segments are reversed in place and the modified sequence is returned.

The indices in the input are 1-based, so the function adjusts them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

## Output 📜

Example usage and expected outputs:

```python
flip_some_elements_in_sequence("8 2 5 3 6")
# Input: n = 8, x = 2, y = 5, a = 3, b = 6
# Output: ['1', '5', '4', '3', '2', '6', '7', '8']
```

```python
flip_some_elements_in_sequence("10 1 4 6 9")
# Input: n = 10, x = 1, y = 4, a = 6, b = 9
# Output: ['4', '3', '2', '1', '5', '9', '8', '7', '6', '10']
```

## Usage 📦

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use the function in your script or interactive Python shell.

Example:

```python
from sequence_flip import flip_some_elements_in_sequence

input_data = "8 2 5 3 6"
result = flip_some_elements_in_sequence(input_data)
print(" ".join(result))  # Output: 1 5 4 3 2 6 7 8
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `flip_some_elements_in_sequence()` function allows for efficient manipulation of a sequence, where specific segments can be flipped in place based on provided indices.
It is a handy tool for working with list transformations in Python.
