# Lesson 2.2: Basic Constructions (Part 2)

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I dive deeper into Python's basic constructions.
The tasks will help me consolidate my understanding of foundational concepts such as data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, and more. By the end of this lesson, I will have practiced applying these constructs in a variety of practical scenarios.

## Purpose üéØ

This lesson aims to reinforce the understanding of Python's essential structures and enhance problem-solving skills through practical exercises.
By completing these tasks, I will learn how to manipulate sequences, handle duplicates, generate lists, and calculate distances, among other essential skills.

## Tasks üîç

1. **2_2_1_calculate_min_distance**  
   This task involves calculating the minimum distance Timur needs to walk to visit two stores and return home. The objective is to optimize the travel route by selecting the shortest paths.

2. **2_2_2_check_letters_language**  
   The task requires checking whether three given letters belong to the Russian or English alphabet or if they are a mix of both.

3. **2_2_3_flip_some_elements_in_sequence**  
   Here, I will manipulate a sequence of numbers by flipping specific segments based on provided indices, allowing me to practice list manipulation.

4. **2_2_4_find_duplicates**  
   This task challenges me to identify duplicate numbers in a sequence and return them in ascending order, enhancing my ability to handle lists and sets.

5. **2_2_5_find_max_group_length**  
   I will group numbers by the sum of their digits and determine which group contains the most numbers, teaching you how to perform grouping operations and handle numerical data.

6. **2_2_6_generate_language_list_for_series**  
   This task helps generate a list of languages known by all members of a group, ensuring that the TV series can be understood by everyone.

7. **2_2_7_find_similar_words_by_vowels**  
   In this task, I'll find words that have the same arrangement of vowels as a given word, regardless of the specific vowels. This focuses on string and vowel processing.

8. **2_2_8_assign_corporate_mailboxes**  
   This task involves assigning unique corporate email addresses to employees at an online school. I will ensure that email addresses are unique by appending a number if necessary.

9. **2_2_9_group_files_by_extension_and_calculate_total_sizes**  
   The final task in this lesson requires grouping files by their extension and calculating the total size of each group, providing insight into file handling and size calculations.

## How It Works üîç

Each task in this lesson applies a fundamental concept of Python programming. I will:

-   Use loops and conditionals to manipulate sequences and handle specific data.
-   Apply basic algorithms to optimize routes, identify duplicates, or process strings.
-   Work with file handling and ensure the uniqueness of values in a collection.

By solving each task, I will develop problem-solving skills and better understand how to apply Python to real-world problems.

## Output üìú

The expected outputs for each task will vary, but you can expect:

-   Minimum distances for travel optimization.
-   Correct identification of letters from different alphabets.
-   Correct manipulation of sequences and identification of duplicates.
-   Correct language lists and processed email addresses.
-   Sorted file lists with total sizes calculated in the largest possible unit.

## Usage üì¶

1. Read and understand the task requirements.
2. Write Python code to implement the required functionality for each task.
3. Test the code with various inputs to ensure correctness.
4. For more complex tasks, break down the problem and tackle smaller parts first.
5. Use the provided hints or solutions if you encounter difficulties.

## Conclusion üöÄ

Completing these tasks will solidify my understanding of Python's basic constructs.
These practical problems will build my confidence in solving algorithmic challenges, and help me apply Python in real-world scenarios more effectively.
