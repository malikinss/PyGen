Lesson 6.11: Self-study material

Self-study material

1. Study the array module yourself. This module allows you to work with arrays, which are very similar to lists, but have restrictions on the data type and size of each element.

Study material:

English documentation is available at the link https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html
Russian documentation is available at the link https://docs-python.ru/standart-library/modul-array-python/
You can read about the main features of the array module at the link https://pythonist.ru/massiv-v-python/

2. Study the deque data type from the collections module yourself. The deque data type is a collection that is similar to a list, except that elements can be added and removed either to the beginning (left) or to the end (right). The deque data type can be used as a queue or a stack.

Study material:

You can read about the structure of deques at the link https://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BA
English documentation is available at the link https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque
Russian documentation is available at the link https://docs-python.ru/standart-library/modul-collections-python/klass-deque-modulja-collections/
A large article about the deque type from Real Python is available at the link https://realpython.com/python-deque/

3. Study the heapq module yourself. This module implements an abstract data structure - a priority queue.

Material for study:

You can read about the priority queue structure at the link https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%8C_%D1%81_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC_(%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5)
