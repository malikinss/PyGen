# Lesson 6.1: List and Tuple Datatypes 📋🔢

## Description 📝

This lesson revisits **Python’s built-in collection types**, focusing on **lists** and **tuples**.
It serves as a refresher before diving into the `collections` module.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Understand the **differences** between lists and tuples.
-   Learn when to use **mutable (lists)** vs. **immutable (tuples)** collections.
-   Reinforce previous knowledge through **15 theoretical questions**.

## How It Works 🔍

Key topics covered in this lesson:

-   **Lists (`list`)** 📜
    -   **Ordered**, **mutable**, and supports **duplicates**.
    -   Common methods: `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`.
    -   Example:
        ```python
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        fruits.append("orange")  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
        ```
-   **Tuples (`tuple`)** 🔗
    -   **Ordered**, **immutable**, and supports **duplicates**.
    -   Useful for **fixed data** like coordinates or settings.
    -   Example:
        ```python
        point = (4, 5)
        x, y = point  # Tuple unpacking
        ```

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I will be able to:  
✅ Differentiate **lists** and **tuples** based on mutability.  
✅ Perform **basic operations** on lists and tuples.  
✅ Understand **when to use** each type for better performance.

## Conclusion 🚀

Lists and tuples are **fundamental** in Python programming.
This lesson reinforces their differences and prepares me for working with more advanced **collections**!
