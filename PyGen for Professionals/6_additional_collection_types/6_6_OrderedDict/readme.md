## Lesson 6.6: OrderedDict Data Type 📚

### Description 📝

In this lesson, I will dive into the **OrderedDict** data type from Python’s **collections module**.
An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which items were added.
It is ideal for scenarios where the order of key-value pairs is significant.

### Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Understand how to use **OrderedDict** to maintain and manipulate the order of dictionary elements.
-   Learn various operations to reorder items within an **OrderedDict**.
-   Master techniques like reversing the order, custom reordering, and sorting based on keys or values.

### How It Works 🔍

This lesson consists of 3 practical tasks that involve **OrderedDict**:

1. **Reversing the Order of an OrderedDict 🔄**

    - **Objective:** Reverse the order of items in an OrderedDict and print it.
    - **Use:** This task demonstrates how to reverse the order of items in an OrderedDict while maintaining its structure.

2. **Reordering an OrderedDict Based on a Custom Rule 🔄**

    - **Objective:** Reorder the elements of an OrderedDict using a custom pattern where the first element, last element, second element, second-to-last element, and so on are placed in a new order.
    - **Use:** This task helps in manipulating the order of elements in a specific pattern, which is useful for alternating access to items.

3. **Custom Sorting of an OrderedDict 📑**
    - **Objective:** Sort an OrderedDict either by keys or values using a boolean argument and perform the sort in place.
    - **Use:** This task covers how to perform custom sorting of the dictionary without creating a new object, ensuring that the dictionary is directly modified.

### Output 📜

After completing the tasks, I will be able to:  
✅ Reverse the order of items in an OrderedDict.  
✅ Reorder elements based on custom patterns.  
✅ Sort items of an OrderedDict by keys or values while preserving the order of equal items.

### Conclusion 🚀

Through this lesson, I learned how **OrderedDict** allows me to manage and manipulate the order of key-value pairs in dictionaries.
Whether I need to reverse the order, apply a custom sorting pattern, or perform in-place sorting, **OrderedDict** offers versatile solutions to maintain order while optimizing the efficiency of operations.
