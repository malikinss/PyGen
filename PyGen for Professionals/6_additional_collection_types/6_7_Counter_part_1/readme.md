# Lesson 6.7: Counter Data Type (Part 1) 📚

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on the **Counter** data type from Python’s **collections module**, which is useful for counting hashable objects.
It provides an easy way to count occurrences of elements in a collection and store the counts in a dictionary-like object.
I will explore several practical applications of this data type.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Understand how to use the **Counter** data type for counting occurrences of elements.
-   Learn to implement the **Counter** for various real-life scenarios like counting file extensions, shopping items, and letter frequencies.
-   Master how to display the results in a structured and sorted manner.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson includes 5 practical tasks that involve using **Counter**:

1. **File Extension Counter 📝**

    - **Objective:** Count how many times each file extension appears in a list of file names and display them in lexicographic order.
    - **Use:** This task demonstrates how to extract and count file extensions from a list of files.

2. **Count Occurrences of a Word in a Sequence of Words**

    - **Objective:** Define a function `count_occurrences` that counts the occurrences of a specific word in a string of words while ignoring case sensitivity.
    - **Use:** This task is useful for analyzing word frequencies in text and can be applied in various text analysis tasks.

3. **Shopping List Program**

    - **Objective:** Count how many times each item appears in a shopping list (input as lowercase, separated by commas) and display the results in lexicographical order.
    - **Use:** This task helps organize and count shopping list items when the quantities are not explicitly stated.

4. **Shopping List Program with Unicode-Based Pricing**

    - **Objective:** Calculate the total price of items in a shopping list based on the sum of the Unicode codes of their letters. The program groups identical items, calculates their total cost, and displays the result in lexicographic order.
    - **Use:** This task helps in calculating the total cost of items in a shopping list based on item names, useful when numeric input is unavailable.

5. **Letter Frequency Counter in Zen of Python**
    - **Objective:** Read the "Zen of Python" text, count occurrences of each letter (ignoring case and non-alphabetic characters), and display the results in lexicographic order.
    - **Use:** This task analyzes letter frequencies in a given text, useful for studying patterns and trends in language or data.

## Output 📜

After completing the tasks, I will be able to:  
✅ Count and display occurrences of file extensions.  
✅ Count word occurrences in a string while handling case insensitivity.  
✅ Count items in a shopping list and organize them lexicographically.  
✅ Calculate and display shopping list prices based on Unicode character sums.  
✅ Count letter frequencies in a given text while ignoring non-alphabetic characters.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will have a solid understanding of how to use the **Counter** data type for a variety of tasks, including text analysis, file extension counting, and organizing shopping lists. It’s an essential tool for efficiently counting and organizing data in Python.
