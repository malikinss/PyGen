# Lesson 6.9: ChainMap Data Type (Part 1) 📚

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will learn about the **ChainMap** data type from Python’s **collections module**.
A ChainMap groups multiple dictionaries or mappings together to create a single, updateable view.
It’s useful for handling multiple levels of context, like when merging configurations or contexts in an application.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Understand how to use **ChainMap** to combine multiple dictionaries and work with them as a single entity.
-   Learn how to perform lookups and updates in a chain of dictionaries.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson includes 2 practical tasks that apply the **ChainMap** data type:

1. **Zoo Animal Count 🦁**

    - **Objective:** This program reads a JSON file containing data about zoo inhabitants and calculates the total number of animals across multiple records.
    - **Use:** The task demonstrates how **ChainMap** can be used to combine different dictionaries of animal counts and compute the total population in the zoo.

2. **Burger Joint Receipt 🍔**
    - **Objective:** This program calculates the total cost of a custom burger order by merging various ingredient categories into a single map, then generating and printing a formatted receipt.
    - **Use:** This task shows how to organize ingredients into categories using **ChainMap** and present the total cost and ingredient list in an ordered and clear format.

## Output 📜

After completing the tasks, I will be able to:  
✅ Use **ChainMap** to combine multiple dictionaries into one logical view.  
✅ Efficiently calculate totals across different categories (such as zoo animals or burger ingredients).  
✅ Present the results in a well-organized and readable format.

## Conclusion 🚀

In this lesson, I have learned how **ChainMap** enables me to group and access multiple dictionaries efficiently.
Whether I am tracking zoo animals or computing burger costs, **ChainMap** provides a powerful tool for managing and manipulating multiple data sources as a single cohesive entity.
