# Lesson 6.4: Named Tuples (part 2) 🔹

## Description 📝

This lesson continues my study of **named tuples** from the **collections module**, demonstrating their practical use in real-world tasks.
I will work through practical problems to deepen my understanding of how named tuples can be applied in Python.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Learn how to **extend** named tuples to add more fields.
-   Work with **real data** using named tuples for better structure and clarity.
-   Understand how to process serialized data, **sort lists**, and organize information effectively with named tuples.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson provides 5 practical tasks involving named tuples:

1. **Create Fruit Named Tuple 🥭**

    - **Objective:** Create a named tuple `Fruit` with fields `name`, `color`, and `vitamins`.
    - **Use:** Store data about fruits in a clear, structured format using a named tuple.

2. **Extend Named Tuple with Additional Fields 🧩**

    - **Objective:** Extend an existing named tuple `Game` to create `ExtendedGame`, adding new fields: `release_date` and `price`.
    - **Use:** Preserve the original tuple's fields while adding more data.

3. **Display Animal Records from Pickle 🐶**

    - **Objective:** Deserialize a pickle file containing named tuples that represent animal records.
    - **Use:** Read and print the animal records in a specified format.

4. **Sort Users by Subscription Plan 📊**

    - **Objective:** Sort users by their subscription plan in descending order, then by email address.
    - **Use:** Work with a list of user data to implement custom sorting logic based on multiple fields.

5. **Process Meeting Data from CSV 📅**
    - **Objective:** Read meeting details from a CSV, sort the meetings by date and time, and display the full names of attendees.
    - **Use:** Read CSV data, convert strings to `datetime` objects, and sort the entries.

## Output 📜

After completing the tasks, I will be able to:  
✅ Use **named tuples** to structure data in a way that is both **clear** and **maintainable**.  
✅ Apply named tuples to **real-world data**, such as animal records and user subscriptions.  
✅ Handle **serialization**, **sorting**, and **data display** efficiently with Python.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson shows me how to take the theoretical knowledge of named tuples and apply it to **practical problems**.
I will now be able to work with named tuples in real-life scenarios, including sorting, extending, and processing structured data.
Named tuples provide a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating my data.
