### `most_popular_student_name()` - Find the Most Common First Name

## Description üìù

The function `most_popular_student_name()` returns the most common first name among the students in the provided list of `Student` named tuples.

## Purpose üéØ

‚úî **Find the most frequent first name** in a list of students.  
‚úî **Efficient grouping** of students based on first name.  
‚úî **Handles the case where the name is unique**.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Sort the list** of students based on the first name.
2. **Group the students** by their first name using `groupby()`.
3. **Count the frequency** of each name and find the one with the maximum count.
4. **Return** the most popular first name.

## Output üìú

### Example Input

```python
students = [
    Student('–ì–∞–≥–∏–µ–≤', '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä', 10),
    Student('–î–µ–¥edka–µ–≤', '–ò–ª—å—è', 11),
    Student('–ö–æ–¥–∑–∞–µ–≤', '–ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π', 10),
    Student('–ù–∞–±–æ–∫–æ–≤–∞', '–ê–ª–∏—Å–∞', 11),
    Student('–®–∏–ª–∏–Ω', '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä', 11),
    Student('–ß–µ–Ω', '–ò–ª—å—è', 11)
]

most_popular_student_name(students)
```

### Output

```plaintext
–ò–ª—å—è
```

## Code Breakdown üõ†

### Step 1: Sort the List by First Name

```python
students.sort(key=key_func)
```

-   The list is sorted based on the first name of the students (`key_func` is a lambda that extracts the `name`).

### Step 2: Group Students by First Name

```python
grouped = groupby(students, key=key_func)
```

-   After sorting, `groupby()` groups the students by their first name.

### Step 3: Find the Most Common Name

```python
most_popular = max(
    ((name, len(list(group))) for name, group in grouped),
    key=lambda x: x[1]
)
```

-   For each group, the size of the group is counted using `len(list(group))`, and the most frequent name is found using `max()`.

### Step 4: Print the Most Common Name

```python
print(most_popular[0])
```

-   The most common first name is printed.

## Usage üì¶

```python
students_data = [
    Student('–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤', '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π', 10), Student('–°–º–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∞', '–ê–Ω–Ω–∞', 11),
    Student('–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞', '–ú–∞—Ä–∏—è', 10), Student('–ö—É–∑–Ω–µ—Ü–æ–≤–∞', '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π', 11)
]

most_popular_student_name(students_data)
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

This function is an efficient solution for finding the **most popular first name** among students in a list, using sorting, grouping, and `max()` to identify the most frequent name. It's a compact and clear approach to the problem.
