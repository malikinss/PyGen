TODO:
    Implement a generator function reverse() that takes one argument:
        - sequence â€” a sequence

    The function should return a generator that produces the elements of
    sequence in reverse order and then raises a StopIteration exception.

NOTE:
    A sequence is a collection that supports indexing and has a length.

    For example, objects of type list, str, tuple are sequences.
