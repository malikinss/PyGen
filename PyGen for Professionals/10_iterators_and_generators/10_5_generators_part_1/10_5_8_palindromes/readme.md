# Palindromic Numbers Generator

## Description 📝

This Python script defines the `palindromes()` generator function, which generates an infinite sequence of palindromic natural numbers.
A palindromic number is one that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this function is to provide an efficient way to generate an infinite sequence of palindromic numbers using a generator.
Palindromic numbers are often of interest in number theory and algorithms.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Generator Function**: The `palindromes()` function is a generator that produces an infinite sequence of palindromic natural numbers.
2. **Helper Function**: The `is_palindrome_number()` function checks if a given number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it with its reverse.
3. **Infinite Sequence**: The generator starts from 1 and continues indefinitely, yielding each palindromic number in the sequence one by one.

## Output 📜

The function yields an infinite sequence of palindromic numbers:

-   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, ...

Example:

```python
for num in palindromes():
    if num > 100:
        break
    print(num)
```

Output:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code to a file named `palindromes_generator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    ```python
    python palindromes_generator.py
    ```
5. Use the generator in a loop to get palindromic numbers:
   Example:
    ```python
    for num in palindromes():
        if num > 1000:
            break
        print(num)
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

This generator function provides a convenient and memory-efficient way to work with palindromic numbers.
By using the power of Python's generators, the sequence can continue indefinitely without consuming excessive memory.
