TODO:
    Implement a generator function years_days() that takes one argument:
        year â€” a natural number

    The function should return a generator that produces a sequence of all
    dates (type date) in the year year.

NOTE:
    Let's take the year 2022 as an example.

    January of this year has 31 days, February has 28, March has 31, and so on.

    Then the generator obtained by calling years_days(2022) should first
    produce all dates from January 1 to January 31, then from
    February 1 to February 28, and so on until December 31.
