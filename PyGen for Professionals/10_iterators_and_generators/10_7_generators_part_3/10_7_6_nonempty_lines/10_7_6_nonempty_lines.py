TODO:
    Implement a generator function nonempty_lines() that takes one argument:
    file â€” the name of a text file, for example, data.txt

    The function should return a generator that produces a sequence of all
    non-empty lines in file with the line break \n removed.

    If a line contains more than 25 characters, it is replaced with
    an ellipsis ....

NOTE:
    When opening a file, use explicit UTF-8 encoding.
