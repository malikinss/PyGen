TODO:
    Implement a generator function that takes one argument:
        iterable â€” the iterable

    The function must return a generator that produces a sequence of elements
    of the iterable object, without duplicates.

NOTE:
    The elements of the iterable object in the generator returned by the
    function must be in their original order.

    The iterable object passed to the function is guaranteed not to be a set.
