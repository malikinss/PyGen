# Lesson 10.7: Generators (part 3) üìù

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on **generator pipelines** and how to efficiently process large datasets or perform tasks that require handling sequences of data.
I will explore how Python generators can be chained together to form pipelines, as well as how they can be used to handle large files or datasets in a memory-efficient manner.
The lesson covers various practical tasks where I can apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Purpose üéØ

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
‚úÖ Understand **generator pipelines** and how they work.  
‚úÖ Learn how to use generators to process large files and datasets efficiently.  
‚úÖ Explore the features of **range objects** and how they can be used with generators.  
‚úÖ Gain insight into the performance benefits of using generators for memory-intensive tasks.  
‚úÖ Learn how to implement and use 12 practical tasks that demonstrate the power of generators in Python.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will focus on the following key topics:

1. **Generator Pipelines**: Chaining multiple generators together to process data in stages.
2. **Processing Large Files**: Using generator pipelines to efficiently process and extract data from large files without loading the entire file into memory.
3. **Performance of Generators**: Understanding how generators can optimize performance by producing values one at a time, reducing memory usage.
4. **Features of Range Objects**: Exploring the use of Python's `range()` object with generators and understanding its memory efficiency.

The lesson includes 12 practical tasks, which I will complete to better understand generator usage and its applications:

1.  **10_7_1_youngest_living_swedish_man**  
    **Goal**: Use a generator to efficiently filter through a list of `Person` named tuples to find the youngest living Swedish male and print his first and last name.

-   This task demonstrates how to use generator pipelines to filter and process data efficiently.

2.  **10_7_2_parse_ranges**  
    **Goal**: Implement the `parse_ranges()` function to parse comma-separated numerical ranges (e.g., "1-5,10-12") and yield each number in those ranges.

-   This task teaches how to generate values from multiple ranges efficiently using generators.

3.  **10_7_3_filter_names**  
    **Goal**: Create a generator that filters a list of names based on specific conditions (e.g., starts with a certain character, contains digits).

-   This task demonstrates filtering data efficiently using generator pipelines.

4.  **10_7_4_get_total_round_a**  
    **Goal**: Use a generator to parse a CSV file of startup investment data and calculate the total amount invested in round 'a'.

-   This task shows how to process large datasets using generators and perform specific calculations.

5.  **10_7_5_years_days**  
    **Goal**: Generate all dates in a given year using a generator.

-   This task demonstrates how to create a sequence of dates and iterate over them efficiently.

6.  **10_7_6_nonempty_lines**  
    **Goal**: Implement a generator that processes a text file and yields non-empty lines, replacing lines longer than 25 characters with an ellipsis.

-   This task teaches how to filter and process text file lines using generators.

7.  **10_7_7_txt_to_dict**  
    **Goal**: Create a generator that reads a `planets.txt` file and yields dictionaries containing characteristics of planets (e.g., name, diameter, mass).

-   This task demonstrates how to parse structured text files and return data in a usable format.

8.  **10_7_8_unique**  
    **Goal**: Implement a generator that yields unique elements from an iterable while maintaining their original order.

-   This task demonstrates how to remove duplicates from an iterable efficiently.

9.  **10_7_9_stop_on**  
    **Goal**: Create a generator that iterates over an iterable and stops when a specified object is encountered.

-   This task teaches how to halt iteration upon reaching a specific item.

10. **10_7_10_with_previous**  
    **Goal**: Implement a generator that yields each element along with its predecessor from an iterable.

-   This task demonstrates how to track and yield previous elements efficiently.

11. **10_7_11_pairwise**  
    **Goal**: Create a generator that yields pairs of consecutive elements from an iterable.

-   This task shows how to handle consecutive elements in a sequence.

12. **10_7_12_around**  
    **Goal**: Implement a generator that yields each element along with its previous and next elements.

-   This task demonstrates how to track elements before and after each item in an iterable.
