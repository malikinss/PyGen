# Parse Ranges Generator

## Description 📝

This Python script defines the `parse_ranges()` function, which takes a string containing comma-separated ranges in the form "a-b" and returns a generator that yields the numbers within those ranges.
The function parses each range and produces the corresponding sequence of numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this function is to parse a string representing multiple numerical ranges and return a generator that can iterate over all the numbers contained within these ranges.
It helps in efficiently processing sequences without generating all values at once, thus saving memory.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input**: The function takes a single argument, `ranges`, which is a string containing multiple comma-separated ranges.
2. **Splitting Ranges**: The `split_ranges()` helper function splits the input string into individual range strings.
3. **Parsing Each Range**: The `parse_range()` helper function converts each range string into a tuple `(start, end)` representing the inclusive range.
4. **Generating Numbers**: The `generate_numbers()` helper function yields numbers from the `start` to the `end` (inclusive).
5. **Output**: The main generator produces all the numbers across all the ranges.

## Output 📜

The function returns a generator that produces a sequence of numbers from the ranges specified in the input string.

Example:

```python
>>> list(parse_ranges('1-2,4-4,8-10'))
[1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code to a file named `parse_ranges.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script and call the function `parse_ranges()` with a range string.
   Example:
    ```python
    print(list(parse_ranges('1-3,5-5,7-10')))  # [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

This generator is an efficient way to handle and iterate over sequences defined by multiple ranges.
It uses Python's generator functionality to process numbers lazily, meaning values are only produced as needed, which is memory efficient.
