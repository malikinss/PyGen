# Total Investment in Round 'a'

## Description 📝

The `get_total_round_a()` function calculates the total investment amount in round 'a' from a CSV file containing startup investment data.
The function processes the file using generator pipelines to efficiently filter and sum the relevant investment amounts.

## Purpose 🎯

This function helps to analyze investment data by focusing on a specific investment round (in this case, round 'a') and provides the total amount invested during that round.
It utilizes Python generators for memory-efficient processing of large datasets.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input Parameters**:
    - `filename`: The path to the CSV file that contains the investment data.
2. **Parsing the File**:

    - The file is opened using UTF-8 encoding, and each line is read.
    - The header row is used to extract column names, and subsequent lines are processed to create dictionaries representing the data.

3. **Filtering the Data**:

    - The data is filtered to include only those rows where the `round` column is equal to "a".

4. **Processing the Investment Amount**:
    - Each valid entry's `raisedAmt` is converted to an integer if it contains a valid number.
5. **Calculating the Total**:
    - The generator expression yields valid `raisedAmt` values, and `sum()` is used to calculate the total investment in round 'a'.

## Output 📜

The function returns the total investment amount in round 'a' as an integer.

### Example:

```python
>>> print(get_total_round_a('data.csv'))
86900000000
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `investment_calculator.py`.
2. Ensure the `data.csv` file is in the same directory or provide the full path to it.
3. Run the function:
    ```python
    result = get_total_round_a('data.csv')
    print(result)  # Output: Total investment in round 'a'
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `get_total_round_a()` function efficiently calculates the total investment in round 'a' using generator pipelines.
This approach is memory-efficient, ensuring smooth handling of large datasets. 🎉
