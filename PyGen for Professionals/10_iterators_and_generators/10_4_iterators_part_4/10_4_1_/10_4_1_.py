TODO:
    Implement a Repeater class that generates iterators, the constructor of
    which takes one argument:
        obj — an arbitrary object

    The iterator of the Repeater class must infinitely generate a single
    value — obj.

NOTE:
    Submit a program containing only the required Repeater class to
    the testing system.
