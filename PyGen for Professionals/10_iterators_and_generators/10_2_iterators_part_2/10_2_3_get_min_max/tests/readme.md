# `get_min_max()` Function 📝

## Description 📝

This function takes a list of comparable objects (`data`) and returns the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in that list.
If the list is empty, the function returns `None`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this function is to find and return the positions (indices) of the smallest and largest elements in a given list, allowing you to easily identify the relative positions of these elements.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Empty List Check**:
    - If the list is empty, the function returns `None`.
2. **Initial Indices**:

    - The initial indices for the minimum and maximum elements are set to `0`, which assumes that the first element is both the minimum and maximum initially.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:

    - Using a `for` loop, the function compares each element with the current minimum and maximum elements:
        - If an element is smaller than the current minimum, its index is set as the new `min_index`.
        - If an element is larger than the current maximum, its index is set as the new `max_index`.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the indices of the minimum and maximum elements.

## Output 📜

For the input list:

```python
data = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
```

The output will be:

```
(1, 5)
```

This means that:

-   The minimum value `1` is at index `1`
-   The maximum value `9` is at index `5`

## Example Usage 📦

```python
data = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
print(get_min_max(data))  # Output: (1, 5)
```

## Conclusion 🚀

The `get_min_max()` function efficiently finds the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in a list.
It's useful for determining the positions of the smallest and largest values when processing data.
