# Lesson 10.2: Iterators (Part 2) 📝

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I dive deeper into **iterator features** and explore some **built-in functions** that generate iterators in Python.
These functions allow me to apply operations on sequences and iterables more efficiently. I also learn how to utilize Python's built-in tools to manipulate collections like lists, tuples, and other iterables.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Understand advanced iterator concepts and features.  
✅ Learn how to use built-in functions like `filterfalse()`, `transpose()`, `starmap()`, and others to work with iterables.  
✅ Be able to perform tasks like matrix transposition and finding the minimum and maximum values in a sequence.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson introduces several built-in functions and techniques to manipulate iterators:

1. **Iterator Features**:  
   I explore advanced features of iterators that enhance how I work with Python sequences, enabling me to perform efficient operations on data.

2. **Built-in Functions That Generate Iterators**:  
   The lesson covers several useful functions that generate iterators:
    - **`filterfalse()`**: A function that inverts the behavior of `filter()`, returning elements for which the predicate function returns `False`.
    - **`transpose()`**: This function transposes a matrix (list of lists), swapping rows with columns. It uses `zip()` under the hood.
    - **`get_min_max()`**: A function that finds the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in a list, returning their positions.
    - **`starmap()`**: This function is used to apply a function to each unpacked collection element in an iterable, allowing for more flexible and advanced operations.

## Practical Tasks 🖥️

1.  **10_2_1_filterfalse**  
    **Goal**: Filter elements that return **False** for a given predicate function using `filterfalse()`.

-   **Explanation**: This function is like `filter()`, but it returns elements where the predicate function returns `False`. It is useful when I want to exclude items that meet a condition.

2.  **10_2_2_transpose**  
    **Goal**: Perform **matrix transposition** using `transpose()`.

-   **Explanation**: I learn how to switch rows and columns in a matrix (a list of lists) using the `zip()` function, making it a flexible tool for data manipulation in 2D structures.

3.  **10_2_3_get_min_max**  
    **Goal**: Find the **minimum and maximum** values in a list of comparable elements.

-   **Explanation**: This task demonstrates how to write a function that returns the indices of the smallest and largest elements in a list. If the list is empty, it returns `None`.

4.  **10_2_4_starmap**  
    **Goal**: Apply a function to each unpacked element in a collection using `starmap()`.

-   **Explanation**: Unlike `map()`, which applies a function to each individual element, `starmap()` is used when the function requires multiple arguments and each element in the iterable is a collection (e.g., tuple or list).

5.  **10_2_5_get_min_max**  
    **Goal**: Find the **minimum and maximum** values in an iterable.

-   **Explanation**: This task builds a function that efficiently identifies the minimum and maximum values from any iterable containing comparable elements, such as numbers or strings.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I will:  
✅ Be proficient in using **iterator features** and **built-in iterator functions**.  
✅ Be able to perform operations like **matrix transposition** and finding **minimum and maximum values** in sequences.  
✅ Have a deeper understanding of how to work with advanced iterators and related tools in Python.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson enhances my Python skills by teaching me advanced techniques for working with iterators and iterable objects.
With the help of built-in functions like `filterfalse()`, `transpose()`, `starmap()`, and `get_min_max()`, I can handle more complex operations on iterables efficiently.
These concepts will be essential for working with large datasets, performing matrix manipulations, and handling more sophisticated tasks in data processing.
