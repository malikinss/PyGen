# `get_min_max()` Function 📝

## Description 📝

The `get_min_max()` function takes an iterable of comparable elements and returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values of the iterable.
If the iterable is empty, the function returns `None`.

## Purpose 🎯

The function's goal is to efficiently identify the minimum and maximum values from an iterable, ensuring that it works for any iterable containing comparable elements (e.g., integers, strings).

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Initialize the Iterator**:

    - The function first converts the iterable into an iterator using `iter(iterable)`. This allows the function to traverse through the iterable one element at a time.

2. **Handle Empty Iterable**:

    - The `try-except` block is used to handle the case when the iterable is empty. If calling `next()` on the iterator raises a `StopIteration` exception, the iterable is empty, and the function returns `None`.

3. **Initialize Min and Max Elements**:

    - If the iterable is not empty, the first element from the iterator is assigned to both `min_element` and `max_element`. This serves as the starting point for comparison.

4. **Iterate Through the Iterable**:

    - The function then iterates through the remaining elements of the iterable. For each element, it checks if it's smaller than the current `min_element` or larger than the current `max_element`, updating the values accordingly.

5. **Return the Tuple**:
    - After iterating through all the elements, the function returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values.

## Example Usage 📦

```python
# Example 1: Non-empty iterable
numbers = [10, 20, 5, 15, 30]
print(get_min_max(numbers))  # Output: (5, 30)

# Example 2: Empty iterable
empty_list = []
print(get_min_max(empty_list))  # Output: None
```

## Output 📜

-   For the input `[10, 20, 5, 15, 30]`, the output is `(5, 30)`, as 5 is the minimum value and 30 is the maximum value in the list.
-   For an empty iterable, the output is `None`, indicating that there are no elements to compare.

## Conclusion 🚀

The `get_min_max()` function is a simple yet effective solution to find the minimum and maximum values in an iterable.
It handles edge cases such as empty iterables gracefully and works with any iterable containing comparable elements.
The use of an iterator ensures that the function is memory-efficient and can handle large datasets.
