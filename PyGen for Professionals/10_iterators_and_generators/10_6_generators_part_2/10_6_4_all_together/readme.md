# Merge Multiple Iterables into One Sequence

## Description 📝

This script defines the `all_together()` function, which accepts an arbitrary number of iterables and produces a single generator that yields elements from all iterables in the order they were passed.

## Purpose 🎯

The function enables the merging of multiple iterables into a single sequence.
It iterates through each iterable and yields its elements sequentially.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **Generator Expression**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each iterable passed in `*args`, and then through each element in each iterable.
-   **Positional Arguments**: The function supports an arbitrary number of iterables, enabling flexibility.

## Output 📜

Example usage:

```python
print(list(all_together([1, 2], "abc", (10, 20))))
# Output: [1, 2, 'a', 'b', 'c', 10, 20]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the function in a Python file, e.g., `all_together.py`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run Python and test the function:
    ```python
    from all_together import all_together
    print(list(all_together([1, 2], "abc", (10, 20))))  # Output: [1, 2, 'a', 'b', 'c', 10, 20]
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

This function provides an elegant and efficient solution for merging multiple iterables, allowing for seamless data processing across various collection types.
