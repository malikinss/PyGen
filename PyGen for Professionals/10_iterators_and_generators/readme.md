# Lesson 10.1: Iterators (Part 1) 📝
In this lesson, I explore **iterators** and **iterable objects** in Python.
I learn the difference between **iterables** (objects that can be looped over) and **iterators** (objects that produce values one at a time).
I also get familiar with built-in functions like `iter()` and `next()` and understand how they work under the hood to traverse sequences efficiently.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand what **iterable objects** are and how they differ from **iterators**.
✅ Learn how to manually retrieve elements from an iterable using `iter()` and `next()`.
✅ Be able to work with **collections and sequences** in an iterator-based approach.
✅ Solve problems using iterators instead of direct indexing, enhancing my Python skills.
```

2. 10_2_iterators_part_2

```
# Lesson 10.2: Iterators (Part 2) 📝
In this lesson, I dive deeper into **iterator features** and explore some **built-in functions** that generate iterators in Python.
These functions allow me to apply operations on sequences and iterables more efficiently.
I also learn how to utilize Python's built-in tools to manipulate collections like lists, tuples, and other iterables.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand advanced iterator concepts and features.
✅ Learn how to use built-in functions like `filterfalse()`, `transpose()`, `starmap()`, and others to work with iterables.
✅ Be able to perform tasks like matrix transposition and finding the minimum and maximum values in a sequence.
```

3. 10_3_iterators_part_3

```
# Lesson 10.3: Iterators (Part 3) 💻
This lesson dives into **magic methods** (also known as **dunders**), the **iterator protocol**, and the **iter()** function features.
Magic methods allow objects to behave like iterators, which is crucial for creating custom iterables.
The lesson also explores how to determine whether an object is iterable or an iterator, and how to create infinite iterators.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn about the **iterator protocol** and how to use magic methods to create custom iterables.
✅ Understand the **features of the iter() function**.
✅ Be able to check whether an object is iterable or an iterator.
✅ Gain the ability to create **infinite iterators** for scenarios requiring endless data streams.
```

4. 10_4_iterators_part_4

```
# Lesson 10.4: Iterators (Part 4) 📝
In this lesson, I dive into creating custom iterators in Python using **class definitions**.
This lesson introduces how to build iterators from scratch, adhering to the **iterator protocol**.
I learn to define the necessary methods to create my own iterator objects and customize them for various use cases.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn how to create my own iterators by writing custom iterator classes.
✅ Understand the **iterator protocol** that requires the implementation of `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
✅ Gain the ability to use these custom iterators in real-world scenarios.
✅ Explore common use cases like infinite loops, bounded repetitions, mathematical sequences, and more.
