# Lesson 4.5: Working with `zip` Files üóÇÔ∏è

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on working with `zip` files, which are commonly used for data archiving and compression.
It provides practical tasks and theoretical questions related to handling `zip` archives in Python using the `zipfile` module.
By the end of the lesson, I'll gain a thorough understanding of how to interact with `.zip` files, manipulate their contents, and utilize the `zipfile` module efficiently.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to teach you how to:

-   Use Python to work with `zip` archives.
-   Perform various operations such as extracting, modifying, and analyzing files within `zip` archives.
-   Gain practical knowledge in using the `zipfile` module to interact with compressed files.

## How It Works üîç

This lesson is divided into 12 theoretical questions and 10 practical tasks. The theoretical part explains concepts such as:

-   `Zip` data format
-   `Zipfile` module functions
-   Data archiving techniques
    The practical tasks guide me in applying these concepts, including tasks like counting files, calculating sizes, extracting files, and more.
    The tasks are structured to build upon each other and help me deepen my understanding of handling zip files.

## Output üìú

Upon completing this lesson, I will be able to:

-   Handle `.zip` archives programmatically.
-   Calculate sizes, identify file compression ratios, and extract specific files.
-   Modify `.zip` archives by adding files, filtering files by size, and performing other manipulations.

## Usage üì¶

Follow these steps to complete the tasks:

1. **Task 1: Count Files in a ZIP Archive**  
   Write a script that counts the number of files in a ZIP archive, excluding folders.
2. **Task 2: Calculate Size of ZIP Files**  
   Create a program that calculates the total size of files within a ZIP archive in both uncompressed and compressed formats.
3. **Task 3: Find Best Compression Ratio File**  
   Develop a script to find the file with the best compression ratio in a ZIP archive.

4. **Task 4: Filter Files Modified After a Given Date**  
   Write a script to filter and display files modified after a specific date.

5. **Task 5: Display Formatted File Info**  
   Create a script that displays detailed file information (name, modification date, size) for all files in a ZIP archive.

6. **Task 6: Write to ZIP Archive**  
   Implement a script that creates a ZIP archive and adds a list of files to it.

7. **Task 7: Get Files Smaller Than a Given Size**  
   Write a script to add only files smaller than a specified size to a ZIP archive.

8. **Task 8: Extract Files from ZIP**  
   Develop a script to selectively or fully extract files from a ZIP archive.

9. **Task 9: Extract Specific Club Players**  
   Create a script that extracts player data for a specific football club from JSON files in a ZIP archive and sorts the players alphabetically.

10. **Task 10: Display ZIP Structure**  
    Implement a script that displays the structure of a ZIP archive, including file sizes in human-readable units.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing this lesson, I will gain hands-on experience working with `zip` archives and become proficient in using the `zipfile` module for tasks such as extracting, adding, and manipulating files.
These skills are essential for working with compressed data and archiving files in Python.
