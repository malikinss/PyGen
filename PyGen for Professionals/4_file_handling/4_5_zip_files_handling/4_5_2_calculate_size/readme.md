# ZIP Archive Size Calculator üì¶

## Description üìù

This program calculates the total size of files in a ZIP archive in both uncompressed and compressed forms.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal is to analyze the storage efficiency of a ZIP archive by comparing the original file sizes with their compressed counterparts.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Extracting File Information**:
    - The program uses `zipfile.ZipFile` to open the archive and retrieve metadata about its contents.
2. **Filtering Out Directories**:
    - Only actual files are considered (folders are ignored).
3. **Calculating Sizes**:
    - The program computes the total size of files before and after compression using `.file_size` and `.compress_size`.
4. **Output**:
    - It prints the sizes in the specified format.

## Output üìú

The program prints two values:

```
–†–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤: <—Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä –¥–æ —Å–∂–∞—Ç–∏—è> –±–∞–π—Ç(–∞)
–†–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä —Å–∂–∞—Ç—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤: <—Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Å–∂–∞—Ç–∏—è> –±–∞–π—Ç(–∞)
```

### Example Output:

```
–†–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤: 105000 –±–∞–π—Ç(–∞)
–†–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä —Å–∂–∞—Ç—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤: 42000 –±–∞–π—Ç(–∞)
```

## Usage üì¶

1. Ensure `workbook.zip` is present in the script's directory or specify its full path.
2. Run the script. It will display the total file sizes in both original and compressed states.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This script provides a quick and efficient way to evaluate the compression efficiency of ZIP archives, helping users understand storage savings.
