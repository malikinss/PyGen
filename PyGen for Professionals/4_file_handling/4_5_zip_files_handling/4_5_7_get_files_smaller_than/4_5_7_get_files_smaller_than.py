TODO:
    You have access to a set of different files, the names of which are
    presented in the file_names list.

    You can also access the files.zip archive.

    Complete the code below so that it adds to the files.zip archive only
    those files from the file_names list whose size doesn't
    exceed 100 bytes.

NOTE:
    You can get the file size in bytes using the getsize() function from
    the os.path module.

    This function takes the path to the file as an argument and returns
    the size of the specified file in bytes.

    For example, you can calculate the size of the files.zip archive in
    bytes and save it in the size variable as follows:
        import os.path
        size = os.path.getsize('files.zip')

    You can also calculate the file size in bytes manually, without
    resorting to third-party modules.
    Think about it ðŸ˜‰.

    Assume that the files from the file_names list and the files.zip
    archive are in the program folder.
