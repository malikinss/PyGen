# Lesson 4.2: Working with CSV Files üìä

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I will learn how to work with `CSV` (Comma-Separated Values) files and other delimited text formats such as `TSV` (Tab-Separated Values) and `DSV` (Delimiter-Separated Values).
I will explore the Python `csv` module, which provides tools to read and write data to `CSV` files.
The lesson covers both theoretical questions and practical tasks to help me understand how to handle different `CSV` operations effectively.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to:

-   Introduce basic file handling in Python.
-   Teach how to read from and write to `CSV` files.
-   Work with `CSV` files containing both numeric and string data.
-   Perform operations like sorting, filtering, and extracting specific data from `CSV` files.
-   Learn how to handle different types of delimiters like semicolons, tabs, etc.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Theoretical Questions**: The lesson includes 8 theoretical questions to help reinforce the concepts related to `CSV` handling. These can be found on the website [here](https://stepik.org/lesson/518491/step/1?unit=510939).
2. **Practical Tasks**: The practical tasks cover a variety of scenarios, including:
    - Reading and writing `CSV` files.
    - Sorting and filtering data based on various criteria.
    - Condensing data and extracting relevant information.

Each task involves using Python's `csv` module to manipulate `CSV` files, helping you practice and deepen your understanding.

## Output üìú

Upon completing the lesson, you will be able to:

-   Read and write `CSV` files using Python's `csv` module.
-   Extract, filter, and process data from `CSV` files.
-   Sort and manipulate the data to produce meaningful results.
-   Work with files that contain different delimiters, such as semicolons or tabs.

## Usage üì¶

To use the solutions for the practical tasks, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository containing the code.
2. Run the Python scripts in the `4_2_csv_files_handling` directory.
3. Each task is contained in its own subdirectory, where you can find the relevant script and sample input files.
4. After running the script, check the output to verify that it matches the expected results.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I will have a solid understanding of how to handle `CSV` files in Python.
I will have gained practical experience working with data in `CSV` format, and I will be able to apply these skills to real-world data processing tasks.
Whether I'm analyzing sales data, processing student records, or managing log files, these techniques will be invaluable in my Python programming journey.
