# Lesson 4.1: Stream Input `stdin` and Output `stdout` 📡

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I focused on stream input (`stdin`) and output (`stdout`) in Python, which are essential for handling user input and displaying output efficiently.
I worked on a series of tasks that involved reading input from the user and processing it in various ways.
The lesson helped me understand how to manipulate and manage input and output streams in Python, which is crucial for many applications, including text manipulation, calculations, and data analysis.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson was to deepen my understanding of handling input and output streams in Python.
By solving practical tasks, I learned how to manage and manipulate input data, process it efficiently, and produce the desired outputs.
These skills are important for many real-world applications, from interactive programs to data processing tools.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson covered the following concepts:

-   **Standard Input (`stdin`)**: Reading data from the user or from a file.
-   **Standard Output (`stdout`)**: Displaying data to the user or writing to a file.

I applied these concepts to solve tasks such as reversing input lines, calculating date differences, determining winners of games, and analyzing sequences of numbers or dates. Each task required different input handling techniques and output formatting to produce the desired results.

## Output 📜

The expected outputs for each task include:

-   Reversed text lines.
-   Calculated time differences between dates.
-   Determined winners in games based on specific rules.
-   Statistics such as the tallest and shortest student heights.
-   Cleaned-up Python code with comments removed.
-   News articles sorted by credibility.
-   Determined sequence orders (ascending, descending, or mixed).
-   Identified the type of progression in a sequence of numbers.

## Usage 📦

1. I cloned this repository to my local machine.
2. I navigated to the directory of the task I wanted to work on.
3. I implemented the function for each task according to the instructions.
4. I ran the programs to verify the results by checking the output.

## Tasks 🎯

The following tasks were included in this lesson:

### 1. `4_1_1_reversed_words_in_input`

#### Reverse Characters in Input Lines

This program reverses the characters in each line of text inputted by the user while maintaining the order of the lines.

### 2. `4_1_2_between_min_and_max_date`

#### Calculate Days Between Max and Min Dates

This program calculates the number of days between the earliest and latest dates from a sequence of dates provided by the user.

### 3. `4_1_3_determine_winner`

#### Sock Game - Determine Winner

This program simulates a sock game where the winner is determined based on who made the last move and whether they drew an even number of socks.

### 4. `4_1_4_display_statistics`

#### Student Heights Statistics

This program calculates and displays the shortest, tallest, and average height of students from a list of heights.

### 5. `4_1_5_count_comment_lines`

#### Count Comment Lines in Code

This program counts the number of lines in a block of Python code that contain only comments.

### 6. `4_1_6_remove_comment_lines`

#### Remove Comment Lines from Code

This program removes all lines containing only comments from a block of Python code.

### 7. `4_1_7_sort_news_by_credibility`

#### News Credibility and Categorization Bot

This program filters news by category and sorts them by credibility in ascending order. If multiple news items have the same credibility, they are sorted by title.

### 8. `4_1_8_print_dates_order`

#### Date Sequence Order Checker

This program checks the order of a sequence of dates and outputs whether the dates are in ascending, descending, or mixed order.

### 9. `4_1_9_determine_progression_type`

#### Progression Type Checker

This program checks whether a sequence of integers forms an arithmetic or geometric progression, or neither.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson greatly improved my ability to handle input and output in Python, allowing me to process data efficiently and produce the desired results.
The skills I gained in managing streams are essential for building interactive applications, performing data analysis, and solving problems in various domains.
I look forward to applying these concepts in more complex projects in the future.
