# Pickle Function Caller 📝

## Description 📝

This program reads a pickle file containing a serialized function, deserializes it, and calls it with a set of arguments provided through standard input.
The function's return value is then printed.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal is to deserialize a function stored in a pickle file and call it with the arguments entered by the user.
This is useful for dynamic execution of functions stored in external files.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program first reads the pickle file name from the input.
2. Then, it reads the subsequent lines as arguments for the function. These arguments are expected to be passed as strings.
3. The `deserialize_pickle()` function loads the function from the pickle file.
4. After deserializing, the program calls the function with the provided arguments and prints the result.

## Output 📜

### Example:

**Input:**

```
func.pkl
Hello
how
are
you
today?
```

**Output:**

```
Hello how are you today?
```

## Usage 📦

1. The program expects the name of a pickle file containing a function.
2. It then expects an arbitrary number of string arguments, each on a separate line.
3. The program will call the function with the provided arguments and print its return value.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program allows dynamic invocation of functions stored in pickle files, making it flexible for various use cases where functions may need to be loaded and called at runtime.
