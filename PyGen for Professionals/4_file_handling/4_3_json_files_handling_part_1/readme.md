# Lesson 4.3: `JSON` files handling (part 1)

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I will explore the `json` data format and how to work with `JSON` files using Python's `json` module.
I will cover the theoretical aspects of handling `JSON` files and learn how to parse and write data in this format.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to provide me with the foundational knowledge required to work with `JSON` files in Python.
By understanding the `json` module and the `JSON` data format, I'll be able to handle data interchange between systems, which is a common task in modern software development.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will learn:

-   The structure and uses of the `JSON` format.
-   How to read and write `JSON` data using Python's `json` module.
-   Key functions in the `json` module, including `json.load()`, `json.dump()`, `json.loads()`, and `json.dumps()`.

This knowledge is essential for tasks like storing data persistently or exchanging data between web services.

## Output üìú

There are no outputs to generate from this lesson, as it focuses on theoretical concepts.
However, I will learn the syntax and behavior of `JSON` functions in Python, which I can apply to future practical tasks.

## Usage üì¶

1. Visit the provided website: [Stepik lesson](https://stepik.org/lesson/518492/step/1?unit=510940) to review the 17 theoretical questions.
2. Read through the explanations provided on the website to deepen your understanding of `JSON` files and the `json` module.
3. Take notes on key concepts such as how `JSON` data is structured, and how to manipulate `JSON` using Python.
4. Prepare for practical tasks where I'll apply this knowledge to work with actual `JSON` files.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I'll have a solid understanding of how to work with `json` files in Python.
I'll be equipped to handle real-world scenarios where `JSON` is used as the data interchange format, especially in web development and APIs.
