# Lesson 4.4: Working with `json` Files (Part 2)

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on working with `JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) files, a lightweight data-interchange format.
It dives deeper into using Python‚Äôs `json` module for reading, writing, modifying, and merging `JSON` data.
The lesson consists of 16 practical tasks that explore various real-world scenarios where `JSON` data handling is required.

## Purpose üéØ

The primary objective of this lesson is to enhance learners' skills in manipulating `JSON` data files.
By completing practical exercises, I will gain hands-on experience in:

-   Converting dictionaries to `JSON` format.
-   Validating and filtering `JSON` data.
-   Merging and updating `JSON` files.
-   Grouping and transforming data using `JSON`.

## How It Works üîç

The lesson is structured into 16 tasks that cover various aspects of working with `JSON` data.
Each task requires applying Python‚Äôs `json` module to:

1. Format and manipulate `JSON` data.
2. Write and read from `JSON` files.
3. Filter, modify, and merge data objects.
4. Use `JSON` for more complex real-world applications, such as filtering student data or grouping countries by religion.

### List of Tasks:

-   **4_4_1**: Print contents of countries as a structured `JSON`-like string.
-   **4_4_2**: Convert and filter invalid keys while serializing a dictionary into `JSON`.
-   **4_4_3**: Write structured football club data to a `JSON` file.
-   **4_4_4**: Ensure Cyrillic characters are not replaced when converting to `JSON`.
-   **4_4_5**: Validate whether a string is correctly formatted `JSON`.
-   **4_4_6**: Print all key-value pairs from a `JSON` object.
-   **4_4_7**: Modify data objects based on predefined rules.
-   **4_4_8**: Merge two `JSON` files and resolve conflicts.
-   **4_4_9**: Add missing keys in `JSON` objects and set them to `null`.
-   **4_4_10**: Group countries by their predominant religions.
-   **4_4_11**: Group playgrounds by administrative district and district name.
-   **4_4_12**: Filter students by eligibility criteria (age and course progress).
-   **4_4_13**: Find students who meet specific eligibility for pool selection.
-   **4_4_14**: Get the best grades for students from multiple exam records.
-   **4_4_15**: Identify the district and chain with the most food service establishments.
-   **4_4_16**: Group food service establishments by type and find the largest by seat count.

## Output üìú

The output for each task varies depending on the exercise.
Some tasks will result in printed data (e.g., key-value pairs, countries grouped by religion), while others will generate modified or merged `JSON` files that can be used for further processing.

## Usage üì¶

To work through this lesson:

1. Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary environment set up.
2. Download or create the required `JSON` files as per each task.
3. Complete the coding exercises by following the instructions provided for each task.
4. After finishing each task, check the generated `JSON` files or the printed output to verify that it meets the expected results.

Example steps for Task 4_4_1:

1. Write a Python script to format and print the country-capital pairs in lexicographic order.
2. Run the script to see the correctly formatted `JSON`-like output.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I will be proficient in handling `JSON` data in Python.
I will have learned essential techniques for converting, validating, modifying, and merging `JSON` objects.
These skills are highly applicable for tasks involving data manipulation, working with APIs, or storing structured data in a format that can easily be shared or stored.
