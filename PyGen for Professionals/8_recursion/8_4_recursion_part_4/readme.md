# Lesson 8.4: Recursion (part 4) 🧑‍💻

## Description 📝

This lesson builds on my understanding of **recursion** and introduces advanced recursive techniques, focusing on **recursive traversal** of nested collections and configuring recursion depth in Python.
The lesson emphasizes practical programming with recursion to process deeply nested structures like lists and dictionaries.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Learn how to recursively process nested lists and dictionaries.
-   Understand how to flatten nested lists, sum integers in nested structures, and retrieve values from deeply nested dictionaries.
-   Gain knowledge of how to configure recursion depth to avoid exceeding the call stack.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson provides **5 practical tasks** to practice recursion, where I will:

1. **8_4_1_recursive_sum**: Calculate the sum of integers in a nested list using recursion.
2. **8_4_2_linear**: Flatten a nested list of integers into a linear list, removing all levels of nesting.
3. **8_4_3_get_value**: Retrieve the value corresponding to a given key in a nested dictionary.
4. **8_4_4_get_all_values**: Collect all values corresponding to a specific key from a deeply nested dictionary.
5. **8_4_5_dict_travel**: Traverse a nested dictionary and print key-value pairs in lexicographical order, handling nested dictionaries.

These tasks will help me deepen my understanding of recursion by applying it in practical situations involving both lists and dictionaries.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I will:  
✅ Be able to recursively sum integers in nested lists, flatten nested lists, and retrieve values from nested dictionaries.  
✅ Understand how to traverse nested structures and print values in a readable, organized manner.  
✅ Gain hands-on experience with recursion depth management in Python.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson enhances my ability to solve problems involving nested structures using recursion.
By mastering tasks like linearizing lists, retrieving values from deep dictionaries, and handling recursion depth, I will be able to efficiently process and manipulate complex data structures.
