# Lesson 8.1: Recursion (Part 1) 🔁
This lesson introduces me to the concept of **recursion**, a technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
It explains both **tail recursion** and general recursion concepts, providing me with the foundation needed to understand recursive algorithms.
By the end of this lesson, I will be able to:

-   Understand the basics of **recursion** and how it works in programming.
-   Differentiate between **general recursion** and **tail recursion**.
-   Apply recursion in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
