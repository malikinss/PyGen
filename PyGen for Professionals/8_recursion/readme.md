# Lesson 8.1: Recursion (Part 1) 🔁
This lesson introduces me to the concept of **recursion**, a technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
It explains both **tail recursion** and general recursion concepts, providing me with the foundation needed to understand recursive algorithms.
By the end of this lesson, I will be able to:
-   Understand the basics of **recursion** and how it works in programming.
-   Differentiate between **general recursion** and **tail recursion**.
-   Apply recursion in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

```
# Lesson 8.2: Recursion (Part 2) 🔁
This lesson dives deeper into recursion, demonstrating its practical applications through 9 tasks that allow me to practice recursive problem-solving.
These tasks help me understand how recursion can be used to replace loops and simplify tasks like printing sequences, reversing lists, and drawing patterns.
By the end of this lesson, I will be able to:
-   Solve various problems using recursion, including printing sequences, reversing inputs, and generating patterns.
-   Understand how recursion can be used in a variety of contexts to simplify code and reduce complexity.
-   Recognize the utility of recursion in different types of problems where iterative solutions might be less elegant.
