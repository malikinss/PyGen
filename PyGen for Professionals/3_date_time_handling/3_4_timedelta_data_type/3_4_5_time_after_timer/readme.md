# Time After Timer ⏲️

## Description 📝

This program takes a time as input and adds a user-defined timer duration (in seconds) to it, then outputs the new time after the specified interval.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to allow users to input a specific time and a timer duration (in seconds), and calculate the time after the given interval.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user is prompted to input a time in the format "HH:MM:SS".
2. The user is then asked to input a timer duration (in seconds).
3. The program calculates the time that will be reached after the specified number of seconds has passed.
4. The new time is displayed in the same format "HH:MM:SS".

### Example:

```python
Please input the time in the format HH:MM:SS (e.g., 10:15:30): 10:15:30
Please input the timer duration in seconds: 4500
Time after the timer: 11:45:30
```

## Output 📜

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the time in the format "HH:MM:SS".
3. Enter the duration of the timer in seconds.
4. The program will display the new time after the timer duration has passed.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program helps users calculate the time after adding a certain number of seconds to a given time, useful for time-based tasks or setting timers.
