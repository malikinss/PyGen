TODO:
    Implement a function saturdays_between_two_dates() that takes two
    arguments in the following order:

        start â€” start date, date type
        end â€” end date, date type

    The function must return the number of Saturdays between the start and end
    dates, inclusive.

NOTE:
    Dates can be transmitted in any order, that is, it is not guaranteed that
    the first date is less than the second.
