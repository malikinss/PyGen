# Lesson 3.1: Date and Time Data Types (Part 1) 🗓️

## Description 📝

This lesson is dedicated to the `datetime` module, which allows me to easily work with dates and times in Python. I explored various date and time data types, learned how to use built-in functions like `str()` and `repr()`, and understood how to manipulate, compare, and format date and time data.

The lesson includes practical tasks that cover different scenarios and functionalities related to working with date and time values.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson was to provide an understanding of how to manipulate date and time data in Python. I was introduced to the `datetime` module and explored its capabilities for formatting, comparing, and calculating date ranges.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I worked with the following main concepts:

-   Date and time data types (`datetime`, `date`, `time`, `timedelta`, etc.)
-   Using `str()` and `repr()` to represent date and time objects
-   Performing date comparisons and finding the range of dates
-   Handling historical dates and generating date ranges programmatically

## Output 📜

The outputs for each task vary depending on the function I implemented, including:

-   Date strings in ISO format
-   Day of the week as an integer
-   The number of hurricanes before a certain date
-   Calculations of fiscal quarters and date ranges

## Usage 📦

1. I cloned this repository to my local machine.
2. I navigated to the directory of the lesson I wanted to work on.
3. I implemented the corresponding function for each task in the files provided.
4. I tested my code using the given inputs and ensured it produced the correct output.

## Tasks 🎯

The following practical tasks were part of this lesson:

### 1. `3_1_1_display_current_date`

#### Output Current Date in ISO Format Function

This function outputs the current date in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

### 2. `3_1_2_display_weekday`

#### Day of the Week for Hurricane Andrew's Landfall

This function calculates the day of the week on which Hurricane Andrew made landfall.

### 3. `3_1_3_florida_hurricane_dates`

#### Count Early Hurricanes in Florida

This function counts the number of hurricanes that hit Florida before the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season.

### 4. `3_1_4_quarter_number`

#### Print Year and Quarter for Dates

This function prints the year and the corresponding quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for each date in a list of dates.

### 5. `3_1_5_get_min_max`

#### Get Minimum and Maximum Dates

This function finds the earliest and latest dates from a given list of dates.

### 6. `3_1_6_get_date_range`

#### Get Date Range

This function generates a list of dates from the given start date to the end date, inclusive.

### 7. `3_1_7_saturdays_between_two_dates`

#### Saturdays Between Two Dates

This function calculates the number of Saturdays that fall between two given dates, inclusive.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson provided me with a solid foundation in handling dates and times using the `datetime` module in Python. By the end of this lesson, I had a deep understanding of how to work with date and time data types, format them properly, and perform useful calculations such as finding date ranges and working with specific days of the week.
