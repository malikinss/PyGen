# Get Date Range

## Description 📝

The `get_date_range()` function generates a list of dates from the given start date to the end date, inclusive.
If the start date is later than the end date, the function returns an empty list.

## Purpose 🎯

This function is useful when you need to generate a list of all dates between two given dates, such as for processing records within a certain date range or generating reports for a specific period.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function first checks if the start date is later than the end date. If true, it returns an empty list.
2. It then converts the start and end dates into their respective ordinal values.
3. The function generates a list of dates using the `fromordinal()` method by iterating over the range of ordinal values from the start to the end date.
4. The result is a list of dates, including both the start and end dates.

## Output 📜

Example output when running the function:

```python
[date(2020, 1, 1), date(2020, 1, 2), date(2020, 1, 3), date(2020, 1, 4), date(2020, 1, 5)]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Provide two `date` objects representing the start and end dates.
2. Call the `get_date_range()` function with the provided dates.
3. The function returns a list of all dates from the start date to the end date inclusive.

## Conclusion 🚀

The `get_date_range()` function is a useful tool for generating date ranges.
It can be particularly valuable for tasks like generating time-based data, creating reports, or filtering records within a date range.
