# Leap Year Checker

## Description 📝

This Python program checks if a given year is a leap year or not.
The user is first asked to input the number of years they want to check.
Then, for each year, the program will output `True` if the year is a leap year and `False` otherwise.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to determine whether the given years are leap years based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **User Input**:
    - The program first asks for the number of years to check.
    - The user then inputs each year they wish to verify.
2. **Leap Year Check**:
    - The program uses Python's built-in `calendar.isleap()` function to check if each year is a leap year.
3. **Output**:
    - For each year, the program prints `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.

### Example:

For input:

```
Enter the number of years: 3
Enter year: 2020
Enter year: 2021
Enter year: 2024
```

The output will be:

```
True
False
True
```

## Output 📜

For each year input, the program outputs either `True` (if the year is a leap year) or `False` (if it is not).

## Usage 📦

1. Save the code in a file named `leap_year_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python leap_year_checker.py`
5. Enter the number of years when prompted, followed by each year to be checked.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a user-friendly solution for determining leap years.
It demonstrates handling multiple inputs and validating user entries in Python. 🎉
