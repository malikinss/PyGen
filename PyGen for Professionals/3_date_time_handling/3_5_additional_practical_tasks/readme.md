# Lesson 3.5: Additional Practical Tasks for `datetime`, `timedelta`, Date and Time Processing ⏰

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I worked on 8 additional practical tasks related to manipulating and processing date and time data.
The tasks explored various ways to handle `datetime` and `timedelta` objects, calculate durations, determine specific dates, and compare employee birthdates, among other use cases.
Each task helped me practice applying my knowledge of the `datetime` module in real-world scenarios.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson was to further strengthen my skills in working with date and time values in Python.
The tasks helped me practice calculating time durations, filtering dates, and working with employee-related date information.
Each task deepened my understanding of how to manipulate date and time objects effectively in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I worked with various date and time operations, including:

-   Calculating total time durations based on given start and end times.
-   Counting how many times the 13th day of the month falls on each day of the week.
-   Calculating how many minutes remain until the store closes.
-   Filtering and displaying specific dates based on conditions like odd sums or avoiding Mondays and Thursdays.
-   Determining the oldest employee and identifying the most common birthdays from a list of employees.
-   Finding the youngest employee with a birthday in the next 7 days.
-   Calculating the time remaining until a course release.

## Output 📜

The outputs for each task vary based on the specific problem being solved, such as:

-   Total time durations in minutes.
-   Occurrences of the 13th day of each month falling on different weekdays.
-   The number of minutes until the store closes or notifications of the store being closed.
-   A list of valid dates that meet certain criteria, printed in a specific format.
-   Information about the oldest or youngest employee, or the most common birthday dates.
-   The amount of time remaining until a course release, formatted as days, hours, and minutes.

## Usage 📦

1. I cloned this repository to my local machine.
2. I navigated to the directory of the task I wanted to work on.
3. I implemented the function for each task as per the provided requirements.
4. I ran the programs and checked if they produced the correct output based on the given input data.

## Tasks 🎯

The following tasks were included in this lesson:

### 1. `3_5_1_get_total_time_duration`

#### Task Duration Calculator ⏱️

This program calculates the total time spent on solving various tasks by computing the total duration (in minutes) between recorded start and end times.

### 2. `3_5_2_count_thirteenth_days`

#### Thirteenth Day Calculator 📅

This program calculates how many times the 13th day of the month falls on each day of the week from 01/01/0001 to 31/12/9999.

### 3. `3_5_3_display_minutes_until_closing`

#### Store Closing Time Calculator 🕒

This program calculates the number of minutes left until the store closes based on the current time. If the store is closed, it displays a message indicating so.

### 4. `3_5_4_display_each_third_date`

#### Date Range Filter Program 📅

This program filters a date range to display every third date that satisfies the following conditions:

-   The sum of the day and month is odd.
-   The date is not a Monday or Thursday.

### 5. `3_5_5_display_oldest_employee`

#### Employee Age Comparison Program 👥

This program identifies the oldest employee from a list of employees with their first name, last name, and date of birth.

### 6. `3_5_6_find_most_common_birthdays`

#### Employee Birthday Popularity Program 🎉

This program identifies which birth dates are most common among employees by counting occurrences and displaying the most frequent ones.

### 7. `3_5_7_find_youngest_employee`

#### Youngest Employee with Birthday in Next 7 Days 🎂

This program finds the youngest employee whose birthday falls within the next 7 days, and outputs a message if no employee has a birthday in the upcoming week.

### 8. `3_5_8_display_time_to_release`

#### Time Until Course Release Program ⏳

This program calculates and displays the time remaining until a specific course release. It outputs the remaining time in days, hours, and minutes.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson enhanced my ability to manipulate and process date and time data in Python.
By working on practical tasks, I deepened my understanding of how to calculate time durations, filter and compare dates, and solve real-world problems using the `datetime` module.
These skills are crucial for tasks involving time management, employee tracking, and even project planning.
