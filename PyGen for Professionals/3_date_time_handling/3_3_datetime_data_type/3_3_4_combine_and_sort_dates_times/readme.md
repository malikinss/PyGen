# Date and Time Merger and Sorter

## Description 📝

This program combines two lists: one with dates and the other with times, creating `datetime` objects.
It then sorts these objects in ascending order based on their seconds value.
If two `datetime` objects have the same seconds value, their original order is preserved.

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to help merge and sort `datetime` objects based on their second value, which can be useful for tasks involving precise chronological ordering.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives two lists: one with `date` objects and another with `time` objects.
2. It combines the corresponding `date` and `time` from both lists to create `datetime` objects.
3. The program then sorts the resulting `datetime` objects by their seconds.
4. If two `datetime` objects have the same seconds value, their original order in the lists is preserved.
5. Finally, it outputs the sorted `datetime` objects, each printed on a new line.

## Output 📜

The program outputs the sorted `datetime` objects in ascending order of seconds. If two objects have equal second values, their original order is maintained.

### Example Usage:

```plaintext
Input:
Lists of dates and times.

Output:
A list of datetime objects sorted by their second value.
```

## Usage 📦

1. Call the function `combine_and_sort_dates_times(dates, times)` with two lists: one containing `date` objects and another containing `time` objects.
2. The function will return a list of sorted `datetime` objects.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is useful for tasks that require combining dates and times from separate lists and then sorting the resulting `datetime` objects based on a specific time component (seconds). It ensures accurate chronological ordering while preserving the original order when necessary.
