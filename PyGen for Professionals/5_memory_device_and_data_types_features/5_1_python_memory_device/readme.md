# Lesson 5.1: Memory Structure in Python 🧠

## Description 📝

This lesson explores the fundamentals of computer memory, including internal and external memory, and how memory is structured in Python.
Understanding memory management is crucial for writing efficient and optimized Python programs.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:

-   Gain a clear understanding of how memory is structured in a computer.
-   Learn about internal and external memory and their differences.
-   Understand how Python manages memory allocation and deallocation.
-   Develop a deeper knowledge of how variables and objects are stored in Python’s memory model.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson consists of explanations and **11 theoretical questions** available on [Stepik](https://stepik.org/lesson/624148/step/1?unit=619836). The lesson covers:

-   The basics of computer memory (RAM, cache, storage).
-   The difference between internal (volatile) and external (non-volatile) memory.
-   Python's memory management, including object storage, references, and garbage collection.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I will be able to:  
✅ Explain the difference between internal and external memory.  
✅ Describe how Python stores and manages objects in memory.  
✅ Understand key concepts such as reference counting and garbage collection.

## Conclusion 🚀

Mastering memory structure in Python is essential for writing high-performance applications.
This lesson provides the foundational knowledge needed to optimize memory usage and avoid common pitfalls like memory leaks.
