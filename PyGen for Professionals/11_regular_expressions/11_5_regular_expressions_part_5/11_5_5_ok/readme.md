# Regular Expression for Matching Consecutive Repetitions of "ok"

## Description 📝

This **regular expression** matches character sequences that contain **three or more consecutive repetitions of "ok"**.
It ensures that the string has **at least three "ok" sequences** in a row without any other characters in between.

## Purpose 🎯

We need to match strings that contain:

-   At least **three consecutive repetitions** of the string **"ok"**.

This means:

-   The string must start with **"ok"** and repeat it for **at least two more times**, making it a total of **three or more "ok" sequences**.

## How It Works 🔍

```regex
r'(ok)\1{2,}'
```

**Explanation**:

-   **`(ok)`** → Captures the string "ok" as a group.
-   **`\1`** → Refers to the first captured group (the string "ok").
-   **`{2,}`** → Ensures that there are at least two more repetitions of the "ok" sequence after the first one, totaling at least **three "ok"** sequences.

---

## Example Usage 📜

```python
import re

regex = r'(ok)\1{2,}'

test_cases = [
    "okokok",    # ✅ Match
    "okokokok",  # ✅ Match
    "okokokokok",# ✅ Match
    "okok",      # ❌ No match (only two repetitions)
    "okokokokokok", # ✅ Match
    "okkok",     # ❌ No match (only two repetitions of "ok")
    "okokokokx"  # ❌ No match (sequence broken by "x")
]

for case in test_cases:
    if re.fullmatch(regex, case):
        print(f'"{case}": ✅ Match')
    else:
        print(f'"{case}": ❌ No match')
```

**Expected Output:**

```
"okokok": ✅ Match
"okokokok": ✅ Match
"okokokokok": ✅ Match
"okok": ❌ No match
"okokokokokok": ✅ Match
"okkok": ❌ No match
"okokokokx": ❌ No match
```

## Usage 📦

-   **Pattern Matching**: Identify repeated patterns in strings, such as "ok" sequences.
-   **Text Validation**: Check if strings contain consecutive repetitions of specific substrings.
-   **Text Processing**: Process or extract strings with repeated patterns for further operations.

## Conclusion 🚀

This **regular expression** successfully matches strings that contain **three or more consecutive "ok" sequences**, ensuring the proper structure and repetition of the pattern.
