# Phone Number Finder
The `find_phone_numbers()` function extracts phone numbers from a given text that match specific formats.
The supported formats are:
-   `7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd`
-   `8-ddd-dddd-dddd`
-   `+7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd` (converted to `7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd`)
where `d` represents a digit from 0 to 9.
This function helps identify and extract phone numbers from any text input.
It can be useful for data validation, text processing, and contact information extraction.
