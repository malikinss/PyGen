1. 11_1_1_find_phone_numbers

```
# Phone Number Finder
The `find_phone_numbers()` function extracts phone numbers from a given text that match specific formats.
The supported formats are:
-   `7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd`
-   `8-ddd-dddd-dddd`
-   `+7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd` (converted to `7-ddd-ddd-dd-dd`)
where `d` represents a digit from 0 to 9.
This function helps identify and extract phone numbers from any text input.
It can be useful for data validation, text processing, and contact information extraction.

2. 11_1_2_beegeek

```
# Regular Expression Matching
The code snippet provides a regular expression that matches the string `beegeek`.
This simple regex is designed to directly match the exact sequence of characters "beegeek" in any input string.
This regular expression can be used for text searching, validation, or extraction when the target string is exactly "beegeek".
It's ideal for use cases where you need to confirm the presence of this specific word in a larger text.
```

3. 11_1_3_sequence

```
# Regular Expression for Matching Sequences
The code snippet demonstrates how to write a regular expression to match sequences in the format `xxx.xxx`, where each `x` represents any character.
The provided regular expression should match three characters, followed by a dot (`.`), and then three more characters.
This regular expression can be used to validate or search for patterns such as IP addresses (without strict digit validation), version numbers, or any text with similar structure, where the format consists of three characters, a dot, and three more characters.
```

4. 11_1_4_integers

```
# Regular Expression for Matching Integers Between 100 and 199
This code defines a regular expression that matches sequences of digits representing integers in the range **100 to 199**, inclusive.
The pattern ensures that only three-digit numbers starting with `1` are matched.
This regular expression can be used in various applications, such as:
-   Filtering numbers within a specific range.
-   Validating input data to check if it falls within 100â€“199.
-   Extracting relevant numerical values from text.
```

5. 11_1_5_phone_numbers

```
# Regular Expression for Matching Phone Numbers
This code defines a **regular expression** that matches **phone numbers** in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx`, where `x` is any digit (`0-9`).
The pattern ensures that the input strictly follows this format.
This regular expression can be used for:
-   **Validating phone numbers** in forms or user input.
-   **Extracting phone numbers** from text data.
-   **Formatting and filtering** structured data.

```
