    HTML elements are the basis of the HTML language.

    Each pair of HTML elements is denoted by a start (opening) tag and an end
    (closing) tag.

    The opening and closing tags contain the name of the element.

    Comments in HTML pages are placed between the <!-- and --> tags.

    Complete the code below so that the regex variable contains the regular
    expression that HTML comments match.

regex = r'<!--.*?-->'
