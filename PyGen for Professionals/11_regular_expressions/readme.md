# Lesson 11.1: Regular Expressions (Part 1) 🔍
This lesson introduces **regular expressions** and their application in Python.
Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate text using patterns.
I will learn about raw strings, character escaping, and different regex patterns for identifying numbers, spaces, alphanumeric characters, and specific text sequences.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand **how regular expressions work** in Python.
✅ Learn to use regex for **searching and matching patterns** in text.
✅ Apply **various regex patterns** to find phone numbers, specific words, and sequences.
✅ Get comfortable with **special characters**, such as `.` for any character and `\d` for digits.
