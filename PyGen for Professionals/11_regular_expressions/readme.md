Chapter 11: Regular Expressions

Chapter Topic: Regular Expressions and re module
Abstract: This chapter is about learning regular expressions and the re module, which allows you to work with regular expressions in Python.

Its divided for 9 lessons wwhich have good theory explonation, 63 practical programming tasks and 95 theoretical questions.

# Lesson 11.1: Regular Expressions (Part 1) 🔍
This lesson introduces **regular expressions** and their application in Python.
Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate text using patterns.
I will learn about raw strings, character escaping, and different regex patterns for identifying numbers, spaces, alphanumeric characters, and specific text sequences.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand **how regular expressions work** in Python.
✅ Learn to use regex for **searching and matching patterns** in text.
✅ Apply **various regex patterns** to find phone numbers, specific words, and sequences.
✅ Get comfortable with **special characters**, such as `.` for any character and `\d` for digits.
```

2. 11_2_regular_expressions_part_2

```
# Lesson 11.2: Regular Expressions (Part 2) 🔍
This lesson explores **regular expressions** in more depth, focusing on advanced pattern matching techniques.
It covers how to match **specific character sets**, **ranges**, **excluded characters**, and even **multiple expressions** at once.
The lesson includes **9 practical programming tasks** and **12 theoretical questions** available on [Stepik](https://stepik.org/lesson/683127/step/1?unit=681950).
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Learn how to match **one of multiple characters** using square brackets `[]`.
✅ Understand how to define **character ranges** and **excluded characters** in regex.
✅ Be able to construct **regular expressions that match multiple conditions**.
✅ Gain hands-on experience with **real-world regex applications**, including validating phone numbers, dates, and times.
```

3. 11_3_regular_expressions_part_3

```
# Lesson 11.3: Regular Expressions (Part 3) 🔍
This lesson continues the deep dive into **regular expressions (regex)**, focusing on pattern matching techniques.
It covers how to match **repeating patterns**, including **one or more characters**, **zero or more characters**, and **optional characters**.
Additionally, the lesson explores **interval-based matching**, as well as the concepts of **greedy and lazy quantifiers**.
By the end of this lesson, I will:
✅ Understand how to use **quantifiers** like `+`, `*`, and `?` for flexible pattern matching.
✅ Learn how to specify **character repetition intervals** using `{n,m}`.
✅ Differentiate between **greedy** and **lazy matching** in regex.
✅ Be able to apply regex to real-world problems like **PAN validation**, **HTML comment extraction**, **ID validation**, and **postcode verification**.
