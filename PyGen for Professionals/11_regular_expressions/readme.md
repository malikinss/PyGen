# Chapter 11: Regular Expressions

## Description üìù

This chapter dives into the powerful world of **regular expressions** (regex) in Python, leveraging the **re module** to manipulate text effectively.

With a well-structured approach, the chapter introduces the basics of regex, followed by more complex techniques for efficient string searching, matching, and manipulation.

The chapter is divided into 9 lessons, covering everything from fundamental regex concepts to advanced usage of the **re module**, with 63 practical tasks and 95 theoretical questions.

Each lesson is packed with hands-on exercises, ensuring a deep understanding of regex applications in Python.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive understanding of regular expressions and their implementation in Python using the `re` module.

By the end of the chapter, I will be able to:

-   Master the syntax and functions of regular expressions.
-   Apply regex for pattern matching, string manipulation, and text validation.
-   Use Python's `re` module to perform practical text processing tasks, such as extracting phone numbers, validating email addresses, and cleaning data.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Regex Basics:** Begin by learning the foundations of regex syntax, including special characters and pattern matching techniques.
2. **Advanced Techniques:** Explore advanced topics such as lookahead/lookbehind assertions, quantifiers, and boundary matching.
3. **re module:** Learn how to utilize Python's `re` module functions (`search()`, `findall()`, `sub()`, `split()`, etc.) to work with regular expressions efficiently.
4. **Hands-On Learning:** Each lesson is supplemented with practical tasks that apply regex to real-world problems, making the learning experience more engaging.

## Output üìú

By the end of the chapter, I will:

-   Be proficient in using regex for a wide variety of tasks, including text validation, extraction, and manipulation.
-   Gain a deeper understanding of the `re` module and how to optimize regex operations in Python.

## Usage üì¶

### 1. 11_1_regular_expressions_part_1

Learn the basics of **regular expressions** and how they work in Python. Master raw strings, escaping characters, and simple regex patterns for matching text, such as phone numbers and alphanumeric sequences.

### 2. 11_2_regular_expressions_part_2

Explore advanced regex techniques, including character sets, ranges, and negations. Learn to construct complex regex patterns for matching multiple conditions.

### 3. 11_3_regular_expressions_part_3

Dive into quantifiers and interval-based matching. Understand **greedy** and **lazy quantifiers** and apply them to real-world use cases, such as validation tasks.

### 4. 11_4_regular_expressions_part_4

Understand how to use word boundaries and line boundaries to create more precise patterns. Practice with tasks like validating capitalized words and handling specific string conditions.

### 5. 11_5_regular_expressions_part_5

Learn about **lookahead** and **lookbehind** assertions to match patterns based on surrounding context. Master both **positive** and **negative** lookaheads.

### 6. 11_6_re_module_part_1

Gain familiarity with Python‚Äôs `re` module and its core functions. Focus on `search()`, `match()`, and `fullmatch()`, and learn how to work with Match objects.

### 7. 11_7_re_module_part_2

Explore the `findall()` and `finditer()` functions in the `re` module. Learn the differences and applications of each function in pattern matching tasks.

### 8. 11_8_re_module_part_3

Master the `sub()` and `subn()` functions for **string substitution** using regex. Learn how to replace text efficiently and perform transformations on data.

### 9. 11_9_re_module_part_4

Learn to use `split()` and `compile()` for splitting strings and pre-compiling regex patterns for better performance in repetitive tasks.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing this chapter, I will become proficient in the use of **regular expressions** in Python and gain a deep understanding of text processing tasks.

I‚Äôll be equipped with the knowledge to handle real-world problems involving pattern matching, string manipulation, and data validation, making me a more effective Python engineer.
