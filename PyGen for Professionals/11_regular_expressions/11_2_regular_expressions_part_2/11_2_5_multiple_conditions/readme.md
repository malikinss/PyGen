# Regular Expression for Matching Character Sequences with Multiple Conditions

## Description 📝

This **regular expression** matches character sequences of length **6** that satisfy all of the following conditions:

1. The first character is any **digit**.
2. The second character is a **lowercase Latin vowel** (`a, e, i, o, u, y`).
3. The third character is any character **except** `b, c, D, F`.
4. The fourth character is any **non-whitespace** character.
5. The fifth character is any character **except** an uppercase Latin vowel (`A, E, I, O, U, Y`).
6. The sixth character is any character **except** a period (`.`) or a comma (`,`).

## Purpose 🎯

This regex can be used for:

-   **Validating specific patterns** in text input that conform to the defined rules.
-   **Filtering data** where sequences must meet specific criteria.
-   **Ensuring compliance** with a custom formatting rule in user or system inputs.

## How It Works 🔍

The regex:

```regex
r'\d[aeiouy][^bcDF]\S[^AEIOUY][^.,]'
```

## Explanation:

-   **`\d`** → Matches a **digit** (`0–9`) as the first character.
-   **`[aeiouy]`** → Matches a **lowercase Latin vowel** (`a, e, i, o, u, y`) as the second character.
-   **`[^bcDF]`** → Matches any character **except** `b`, `c`, `D`, or `F` as the third character.
-   **`\S`** → Matches any **non-whitespace** character (excluding spaces, tabs, etc.) as the fourth character.
-   **`[^AEIOUY]`** → Matches any character **except** an **uppercase Latin vowel** (`A, E, I, O, U, Y`) as the fifth character.
-   **`[^.,]`** → Matches any character **except** a period (`.`) or comma (`,`) as the sixth character.

## Output 📜

Example usage:

```python
import re

text = "Valid sequences are: 1a5@z3!a2b, 2e8#iM4$X, and 3o9X*P8."
regex = r'\d[aeiouy][^bcDF]\S[^AEIOUY][^.,]'

matches = re.findall(regex, text)
print("Matches:", matches)
```

### Output:

```
Matches: ['1a5@z3!']
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the regex in a Python script.
2. Use Python's `re` module to apply the regex to a string.
3. Run the script and check for valid matches.

## Conclusion 🚀

This regex provides a comprehensive solution for matching sequences of length 6, with each character following strict rules, such as digit placement, exclusions, and specific character conditions. It ensures precise pattern matching for complex input validation.
