# Section 3: Input and Output - Final Test 📥📤

Welcome to Section 3 of the course!
This section focuses on a final test that consolidates my knowledge of input and output operations.
I'll tackle comprehensive tasks that integrate what I've learned so far.

## Description 📝
This section is designed as a final assessment of my understanding of input and output in programming.
I will work on two parts of a final test that cover various aspects of handling data.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this section is to evaluate my ability to apply input and output techniques in a more complex context.
It aims to ensure I can effectively use these concepts in practical scenarios.

## How It Works 🔍
- **3_1_part1**: This part of the final test will require I to solve a problem using the input and output techniques I've learned.
- **3_2_part2**: The second part continues with additional challenges, further testing my understanding and application of input and output operations.

## Output 📜
The output for each part of the final test will depend on the specific problems and the input provided.
Make sure to run my solutions and verify that they meet the requirements of each part.

## Usage 📦
1. Navigate to the relevant task directory (`3_1_part1` or `3_2_part2`).
2. Open the files to review or execute the code.
3. Follow the instructions for each part of the test and check my solutions against the expected outcomes.

## Conclusion 🚀
This section represents the culmination of my learning about input and output. 
Completing these final tasks will demonstrate my proficiency and readiness for more advanced topics.
