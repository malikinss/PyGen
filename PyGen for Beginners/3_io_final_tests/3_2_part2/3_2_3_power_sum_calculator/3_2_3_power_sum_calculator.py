TODO:
    As you know, integers in Python do not have the limitations that are found
    in other programming languages.

    Write a program that reads four positive integers a, b, c, and d and
    prints the value of the expression a^b + c^d.
'''
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())

print(a**b + c**d)
