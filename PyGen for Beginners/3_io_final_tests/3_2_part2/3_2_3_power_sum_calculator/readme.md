# Integer Power Sum Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program reads four positive integers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and computes the value of the expression \(a^b + c^d\), demonstrating Python's ability to handle large integers without overflow issues.

## Purpose 🎯
The program shows how Python handles exponentiation and performs calculations involving large integers, which is particularly useful for operations involving powers of large numbers.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to input four integers: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
2. **Calculation**:
   - The program computes the result of the expression \(a^b + c^d\) using Python's exponentiation operator (`**`).
3. **Output**:
   - The result is printed directly to the console.

## Output 📜
The program outputs the result of \(a^b + c^d\) for the given integers.

### Example:
For input values:
    `a = 2`
    `b = 3`
    `c = 4`
    `d = 2`

The output will be:
    `20`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `3_2_3_power_sum_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 3_2_3_power_sum_calculator.py`
5. Enter four positive integers when prompted, and the program will display the calculated result.

## Conclusion 🚀
This simple program illustrates Python's power to perform calculations involving large integers efficiently.
It is a great tool for experimenting with large exponents and learning how Python handles large numeric values without typical language constraints.
Enjoy computing! 😊
