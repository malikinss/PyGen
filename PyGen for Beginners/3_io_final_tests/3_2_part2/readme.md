# Lesson 3.2 Part 2: Advanced Calculations and Patterns 📏

## Description 📝
This lesson continues exploring advanced arithmetic and geometric operations, focusing on pattern creation and summation techniques using loops and mathematical formulas.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to solidify your understanding of creating visual patterns with loops and to practice more complex summation and calculation tasks.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, I will:
- Create geometric shapes using characters like asterisks.
- Perform summation of numbers in various contexts, such as powers and repeated digits.
- Develop calculators that handle both geometric and arithmetic operations.

## Tasks 📜

### 3.2.1 Asterisk Rectangle
This Python script prints a rectangle with asterisks (`*`) forming its perimeter.

### 3.2.2 Square and Sum Calculator
This Python program reads two integers from the user and computes:
1. The square of their sum: \((a + b)^2\)
2. The sum of their squares: \(a^2 + b^2\)

### 3.2.3 Power Sum Calculator
This Python program reads four positive integers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and computes the value of the expression \(a^b + c^d\), demonstrating Python's ability to handle large integers without overflow issues.

### 3.2.4 Summation of Repeated Digits
This Python program reads a positive integer `n` (where \( n \in [1, 9] \)) and computes the value of the expression \(n + nn + nnn\).

## Conclusion 🚀
By completing this lesson, I will have gained experience in both creating geometric patterns and handling more advanced arithmetic operations.
These skills are essential for solving complex programming problems.
