# Square of Sum and Sum of Squares Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program reads two integers from the user and computes:
1. The square of their sum: \((a + b)^2\)
2. The sum of their squares: \(a^2 + b^2\)

It then prints the results in a formatted output.

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and exponentiation in Python, and how to format output strings in a readable manner.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to input two integers, `a` and `b`.
2. **Calculations**:
   - **Square of the Sum**: The program calculates \((a + b)^2\).
   - **Sum of the Squares**: The program computes \(a^2 + b^2\).
3. **Output**:
   - The results are printed in a descriptive format using string concatenation and arithmetic expressions.

## Output 📜
The program produces output in the following format:
    `The square of the sum of <a> and <b> is <result of (a + b)^2>`
    `The sum of the squares of <a> and <b> is <result of a^2 + b^2>`


### Example:
For inputs `a = 3` and `b = 4`, the output would be:
    `The square of the sum of 3 and 4 is equal to 49`
    `The sum of the squares of 3 and 4 is equal to 25`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `3_2_2_square_and_sum_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 3_2_2_square_and_sum_calculator.py`
5. The program will prompt you to enter two integers and display the calculated results.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program is a simple example of using basic arithmetic operations and formatted output in Python.
It helps reinforce the concepts of exponentiation and how to structure a program's output for clarity.
Happy coding! 😊
