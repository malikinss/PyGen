# Section 7: Loops 🔄

## Overview 📚

Section 7 focuses on mastering loops, one of the fundamental control structures in programming.
Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over sequences, and implementing efficient algorithms.
This section contains **58 practice tasks** divided for **9 lessons** that cover various aspects of loops, including `for` and `while` loops, control flow tools (`break`, `continue`, `else`), nested loops, and more.
