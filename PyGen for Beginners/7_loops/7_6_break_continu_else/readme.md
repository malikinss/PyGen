# Lesson 7.6: Break, Continue, Else in Loops 🔄

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on the `break`, `continue`, and `else` keywords in loops.
It includes tasks that demonstrate how these control flow tools can be used to manage loop behavior, exit loops early, skip certain iterations, and apply optional blocks like `else` in loops.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to learn how to control the flow of loops using `break` and `continue`, and to understand the optional `else` clause in loops.
These tools help optimize the logic and flow of programs involving loops.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will:

-   Learn how to use the `break` statement to exit loops early.
-   Practice using the `continue` statement to skip certain iterations.
-   Understand the behavior of the `else` keyword when used in loops.
-   Solve problems where these control flow structures are useful for handling specific conditions and ranges.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.6.1 Smallest Divisor

This Python program calculates the smallest divisor of a given number \( n > 1 \), other than 1.
It checks each integer starting from 2, using a loop to find the first number that divides \( n \) without a remainder.

### 7.6.2 Print Excluded Numbers

This Python program prints numbers from \( 1 \) to \( n \), excluding those within the following ranges:

-   \( 5 \) to \( 9 \)
-   \( 17 \) to \( 37 \)
-   \( 78 \) to \( 87 \)

The program uses control flow to skip over these ranges efficiently and ensures the sequence of printed numbers remains correct.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson strengthens the understanding of how `break`, `continue`, and `else` can control loop behavior and enhance the efficiency of programs.
Mastery of these tools is crucial for developing more advanced and optimized solutions in programming.
