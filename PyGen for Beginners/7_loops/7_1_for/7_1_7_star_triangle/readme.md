# Star Triangle Printer 🌟

## Description 📝
This program generates and prints a right-angled isosceles triangle using stars (`*`). The height of the triangle is determined by a natural number input from the user, ensuring that the triangle is formed correctly based on the specified dimensions.

## Purpose 🎯
The main purpose of this program is to demonstrate the ability to construct a right-angled isosceles triangle with a specified leg length using loops and string multiplication in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. The user is prompted to input a natural number `n`, which represents the leg of the triangle.
2. The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
3. A loop runs from `0` to `n`, printing stars in decreasing order, forming a triangle shape.

## Usage 📦
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a Python file `7_1_7_star_triangle.py`.
3. Run the program in the terminal or command prompt using:
   `python 7_1_7_star_triangle.py`
4. When prompted, enter a natural number greater than or equal to 2.
5. The triangle will be printed to the console.

## Conclusion 🚀
This simple program serves as an excellent exercise in using loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
It provides a clear example of how to handle basic validation and produce formatted output.
