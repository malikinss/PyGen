# Population Growth Predictor 🦠

## Description 📝

This program predicts the population growth of a group of organisms over a specified number of days, based on an initial population, an average daily percentage increase, and the number of breeding days.

## Purpose 🎯

This program helps estimate how a population grows over time given specific growth rates, making it useful for ecological modeling and educational purposes.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts three inputs:
    - The starting number of organisms (`initial_population`).
    - The daily average increase in percentage (`daily_increase_percent`).
    - The number of days for the growth simulation (`days`).
2. Using these inputs, the program calculates the new population size for each day.
3. Each day’s population size is printed, starting from Day 1 and ending on Day `n`.

## Output 📜

The output shows the population size for each day, formatted to two decimal places.
For example: `Day 1: 100.00 Day 2: 105.00 Day 3: 110.25`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter:
    - The starting number of organisms (e.g., `100`).
    - The daily percentage increase (e.g., `5`).
    - The number of days to predict the growth (e.g., `3`).
3. Observe the predicted population for each day based on the growth rate.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple simulation for predicting population growth over time based on user-provided initial data.
It’s a valuable tool for understanding exponential growth dynamics.
