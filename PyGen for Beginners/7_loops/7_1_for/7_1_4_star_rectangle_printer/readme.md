# Star Rectangle Printer

## Description 📝
This Python program prints a rectangle of stars (*) with dimensions `n * 19`, where `n` is a natural number input by the user.

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates how to use loops to create repeated patterns, in this case, a rectangle made of stars.
It helps users practice control flow and output formatting in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a natural number `n`, representing the height of the rectangle.
2. **Star Rectangle**:
   - The program prints `n` rows, each consisting of 19 stars. This is achieved by a loop that runs `n` times, printing a row of 19 stars in each iteration.
   
## Output 📜
For an input value `n = 3`, the program will print:
    The rectangle always has a width of 19 stars, and the height depends on the user's input value `n`.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `7_1_4_star_rectangle_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 7_1_4_star_rectangle_printer.py`
5. Input a natural number `n` when prompted, and the program will print a rectangle with that height.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program is a simple yet effective way to understand how loops can be used to create patterns in Python.
It emphasizes control structures and formatting, providing a useful example for beginners.
