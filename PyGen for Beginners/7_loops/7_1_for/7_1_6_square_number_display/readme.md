# Square Number Display

## Description 📝
This Python program takes a natural number \( n \) as input and displays the square of each number from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive) in a formatted message.

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates how to compute squares of numbers in a given range and provides a practical application of loops and formatted strings in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a natural number \( n \).
2. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the input is a natural number (non-negative integer). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
3. **Output**:
   - It calculates and prints the square of each number from 0 to \( n \) in the format:
        The square of the number [number] is equal to [square]

## Output 📜
For an input of \( 3 \), the output will be:
The square of the number 0 is equal to 0 The square of the number 1 is equal to 1 The square of the number 2 is equal to 4 The square of the number 3 is equal to 9

If the user inputs a negative number or a non-integer, the program will display an error message:
    Error: Input must be a natural number.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `7_1_6_square_number_display.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 7_1_6_square_number_display.py`
5. Enter a natural number when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program serves as a simple yet effective example of how to handle user input, perform mathematical operations, and display results in Python. It reinforces the concepts of loops and error handling while providing valuable user feedback.
