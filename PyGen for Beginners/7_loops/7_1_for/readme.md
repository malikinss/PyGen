# Lesson 7.1: For Loop in Python üîÑ

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on the `for` loop in Python, explaining how to use it to repeat certain actions multiple times.
It includes tasks that require repeating actions based on conditions, exploring the concept of loop variables, and demonstrating the power of loops in solving problems efficiently.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to help understand how to use `for` loops in programming.
It will enable the creation of programs that can repeat tasks multiple times, simplifying complex problems and reducing code redundancy.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I:

-   Learn how to use the `for` loop to repeat actions.
-   Understand the role of the loop variable in controlling the flow of the loop.
-   Implement various programs that use loops to perform repeated tasks, such as printing messages, creating patterns, and solving real-world problems.

## Tasks üìú

### 7_1_1 Print Message

This Python program prints the message "Python is awesome!" a total of 10 times. It's a simple demonstration of using a loop to repeat an action.

### 7_1_2 Sentence Repeater

This Python program takes a sentence and a number as input, then repeats the given sentence the specified number of times.

### 7_1_3 Character Sequence Printer

This Python program prints a specific sequence of characters using exactly three `for` loops, demonstrating basic control flow in programming.

### 7_1_4 Star Rectangle Printer

This Python program prints a rectangle of stars (`*`) with dimensions `n * 19`, where `n` is a natural number input by the user.

### 7_1_5 Numbered Sentence Repeater

This Python program reads a sentence from the user and prints it 10 times, each line numbered from 0 to 9. The program also includes error handling to ensure that the input is not empty.

### 7_1_6 Square Number Display

This Python program takes a natural number \( n \) as input and displays the square of each number from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive) in a formatted message.

### 7_1_7 Star Triangle

This program generates and prints a right-angled isosceles triangle using stars (`*`). The height of the triangle is determined by a natural number input from the user, ensuring that the triangle is formed correctly based on the specified dimensions.

### 7_1_8 Predict Population Growth

This program predicts the population growth of a group of organisms over a specified number of days, based on an initial population, an average daily percentage increase, and the number of breeding days.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson helps deepen the understanding of loops in Python, particularly the `for` loop.
By mastering the use of loops, I can significantly reduce redundancy in code and solve complex problems more efficiently.
The tasks in this lesson provide practical experience in using loops for various real-world applications.
