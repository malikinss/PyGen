## Description 📝
This Python program takes a sentence and a number as input, then repeats the given sentence the specified number of times.

## Purpose 🎯
The program helps users understand how to work with loops and user input in Python, providing a practical application of basic programming concepts.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a sentence.
   - It then asks for the number of times the sentence should be repeated.
2. **Repetition**:
   - It uses a `for` loop to iterate the specified number of times, printing the sentence in each iteration.

## Output 📜

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 7_1_2_sentence_repeater.py`
5. Enter the sentence and the number of repetitions when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a simple way to demonstrate loops and user input in Python, allowing users to repeat any sentence as many times as desired. 🔁
