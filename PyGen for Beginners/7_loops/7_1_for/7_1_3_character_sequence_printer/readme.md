# Character Sequence Printer

## Description 📝
This Python program prints a specific sequence of characters using exactly three `for` loops, demonstrating basic control flow in programming.

## Purpose 🎯
The program serves as a simple exercise to understand how to utilize loops in Python, allowing users to print repetitive patterns easily.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **Row Definitions**:
   - The program defines three character strings: `row_A`, `row_B`, and `row_T`, which contain the characters to be printed.
2. **Printing Rows**:
   - It uses the first `for` loop to print `row_A` six times.
   - The second `for` loop prints `row_B` five times.
   - The program prints the character `E` once.
   - The third `for` loop prints `row_T` nine times.
   - Finally, it prints the character `G`.

## Output 📜
The program displays the following sequence of characters:
AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA BBBB BBBB BBBB BBBB BBBB E TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT TTTTT G

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `7_1_3_character_sequence_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 7_1_3_character_sequence_printer.py`

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively demonstrates the use of loops in Python to produce specific character patterns, illustrating basic programming concepts in a fun and visual way. 🎉
