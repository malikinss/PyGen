# Prime Numbers in Range

## Description 📝

This program finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range [a, b], where `a` and `b` are natural numbers, and `a < b`. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

The program works by iterating through all numbers in the specified range, checking if each number is prime, and printing the prime numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of the program is to identify and print all prime numbers between two natural numbers `a` and `b` (inclusive). This can be useful for tasks related to number theory, cryptography, or mathematical research.

### Example:

```bash
Input: 10 30
Output: 11 13 17 19 23 29
```

In this example, the prime numbers between 10 and 30 are printed:

-   `11`, `13`, `17`, `19`, `23`, `29`.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives two natural numbers `a` and `b`, where `a < b`.
2. It iterates through each number from `a` to `b` and checks whether the number is prime.
3. A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
4. The program prints all prime numbers found within the specified range.

## Output 📜

The program prints each prime number on a new line.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input two natural numbers `a` and `b` such that `a < b`.
3. The program will output all prime numbers between `a` and `b`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program efficiently identifies and prints all prime numbers within a given range [a, b], making it a useful tool for exploring prime numbers and their properties.
