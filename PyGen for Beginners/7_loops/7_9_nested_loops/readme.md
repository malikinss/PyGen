# Lesson 7.9: Nested Loops Part 2 🔄

## Description 📝

This lesson continues the exploration of nested loops, focusing on their advanced applications in generating patterns, solving mathematical problems, and performing iterative calculations.
The lesson also demonstrates the use of `break` and `continue` operators in complex scenarios.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Deepen understanding of nested loops through complex tasks.
-   Explore practical applications such as generating numerical patterns, calculating factorials, and finding prime numbers.
-   Develop problem-solving skills using iterative algorithms.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson builds on the concept of nested loops and applies them to more intricate problems, showcasing their versatility in solving tasks that require multiple levels of iteration.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.9.1 Print Numerical Triangle

This program prints a triangle of consecutive numbers, where each row contains \(i\) numbers starting from 1.
The numbers increment as the rows increase, creating a growing triangle.

### 7.9.2 Print Number Triangle

This program generates a symmetrical number triangle, where each row \(i\) consists of numbers incrementing from 1 to \(i\) and then decrementing back to 1.

### 7.9.3 Max Sum of Divisors

This program finds the natural number within the range [a, b] that has the highest sum of divisors.
If multiple numbers share the same sum, the largest number is chosen.

### 7.9.4 Display Divisibility

This program visually represents the divisibility of numbers from 1 to \(n\).
For each number, it prints the number followed by as many "+" symbols as there are divisors for that number.

### 7.9.5 Digital Root

This program calculates the **digital root** of a given natural number by repeatedly summing its digits until a single-digit result is obtained.

### 7.9.6 Factorial Sum

This program computes the sum of factorials from 1! to \(n!\).
The factorial of each number in the range is calculated and summed to produce the final result.

### 7.9.7 Find Primes in Range

This program identifies and prints all prime numbers within a specified range [a, b].
A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson showcases the flexibility of nested loops in handling complex problems.
By completing the tasks, learners gain deeper insight into iterative logic and develop proficiency in implementing nested loops for practical and theoretical challenges.
