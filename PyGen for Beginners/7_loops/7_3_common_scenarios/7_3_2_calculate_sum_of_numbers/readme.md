# Calculate Sum of Given Numbers ➕

## Description 📝

This program calculates the sum of `n` integers, where `n` is a natural number provided by the user.
The user inputs the number of integers to sum, followed by each integer on a new line.
The program then computes the total sum of all the given integers.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic input/output handling and looping in Python.
It is an essential exercise for beginners to practice reading user input, performing arithmetic operations, and working with loops.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user is prompted to input the total number of integers `n`.
2. The program then takes `n` individual integers from the user, each on a separate line.
3. The program sums these integers and outputs the final result.

## Output 📜

The output is the total sum of the integers provided by the user. For example, if the input is:
`3 1 2 3`
The output will be:
`6`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input a natural number `n`, which represents how many integers you will provide.
3. Enter `n` integers, one per line.
4. The program will display the sum of the given integers.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple way to calculate the sum of multiple numbers using user input.
It is useful for beginners learning to work with loops, input handling, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
