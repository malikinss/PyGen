# Evaluate Expression (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) - ln(n) ➗

## Description 📝

This program calculates the value of the expression `(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) - ln(n)` for a given natural number `n`.
The program adds the reciprocals of all numbers from 1 to `n` and subtracts the natural logarithm of `n`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of loops, series summation, and the `log()` function from the `math` module in Python.
It helps users practice working with mathematical expressions and basic Python functions.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user inputs a natural number `n`.
2. The program sums the reciprocals of numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. The program subtracts the natural logarithm of `n` from the sum.
4. It returns and prints the result of the evaluation.

## Output 📜

The output is the value of the expression `(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) - ln(n)` for the provided `n`. For example, if the input is:
`3`
The output will be:
`1.0066951531215767`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input a natural number `n`.
3. The program will calculate and print the result of the expression `(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) - ln(n)`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program offers a simple approach to evaluating a mathematical expression that combines series summation and logarithmic functions, demonstrating basic programming techniques and mathematical computations in Python.
