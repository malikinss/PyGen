# Largest and Second Largest Numbers

## Description 📝

This program reads a sequence of `n` natural numbers and calculates the largest and second largest numbers in the sequence.
It then prints these two numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to find and print the largest and second largest numbers in a given sequence of natural numbers.
This is commonly useful in various applications where ranking or selection of top elements is required.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user enters the number `n`, which represents the number of elements in the sequence.
2. The program iterates through the sequence and keeps track of the largest and second largest numbers encountered.
3. It updates the largest and second largest values as it processes each number.
4. Finally, it prints the largest and second largest numbers.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs two values:
    1. The largest number in the sequence.
    2. The second largest number in the sequence.

For example:

```bash
Input: 5 10 20 30 5 25

Output: Largest: 30 Second Largest: 25
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the total number of elements (`n`).
3. Enter `n` different natural numbers, one per line.
4. The program will print the largest and second largest numbers from the sequence.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides an efficient way to find the largest and second largest numbers in a sequence of natural numbers.
It handles various edge cases such as fewer than two numbers by providing an appropriate message.
