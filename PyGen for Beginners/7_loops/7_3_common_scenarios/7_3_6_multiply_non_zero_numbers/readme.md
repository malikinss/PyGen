# Non-Zero Number Multiplication

## Description 📝

This program reads 10 integers from the user and calculates the product of all non-zero numbers.
If no non-zero numbers are entered, it prints `0`.
This program demonstrates how to handle user input, iterate over a set of numbers, and perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to multiply non-zero numbers from a set of 10 input values. If all the input numbers are zero, the program outputs `0`.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user is prompted to input 10 numbers.
2. The program checks each number:
    - If the number is non-zero, it multiplies it with the accumulated product.
    - If the number is zero, it is ignored.
3. After processing all 10 numbers, the program prints the product of the non-zero numbers.
   If no non-zero numbers were entered, it prints `0`.

## Output 📜

-   If at least one non-zero number is entered, the program outputs the product of all non-zero numbers.
-   If all entered numbers are zero, the program outputs `0`.

For example:

```bash
Input: 1 0 3 0 5 2 0 7 0 4

Output: 210
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter 10 numbers when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and print the product of non-zero numbers.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to handle input, perform conditional checks, and iterate over a sequence of numbers in Python.
It can be modified for various tasks involving product calculations based on conditions.
