# Count Numbers with Special Cubes 🧮

## Description 📝

This program counts how many numbers between two integers `a` and `b` (inclusive) have a cube that ends in either 4 or 9.
The program performs this check for each number in the specified range.

## Purpose 🎯

This program is designed to identify and count numbers whose cubes end with specific digits (4 or 9).
It serves as a good exercise for handling loops, mathematical operations, and conditional statements in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program prompts the user to input two integers, `a` and `b`, where `a ≤ b`.
2. It then iterates over each number in the range from `a` to `b`.
3. For each number, the program computes the cube and checks if the last digit is either 4 or 9.
4. The count of such numbers is then printed.

## Output 📜

For an input range from `a = 1` to `b = 10`, the output will be the number of integers in that range whose cubes end in 4 or 9. For example, if the cube of the number 2 (which is 8) does not end in 4 or 9, but the cube of 3 (which is 27) does end in 9.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter two integers, `a` and `b`, where `a ≤ b`.
3. The program will print the count of numbers whose cubes end in 4 or 9.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a way to find special numbers in a given range by leveraging mathematical operations and conditional checks.
It is useful for beginners learning to work with loops and number properties in Python.
