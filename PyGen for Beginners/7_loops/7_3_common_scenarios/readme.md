# 7_3_Common_Scenarios: Common Programming Scenarios üß©

## Description üìù

This directory contains Python programs that demonstrate common programming scenarios often encountered when working with loops, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.
Each program focuses on specific tasks like counting, calculating sums and products, exchanging variable values, evaluating mathematical expressions, and more.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this directory is to practice and solidify knowledge of fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditions, mathematical operations, and using Python's built-in functions and modules.
These exercises are ideal for beginners to get hands-on experience in handling real-world problems with Python.

## Tasks üìú

### 7_3_1_count_numbers_with_special_cubes

This program counts how many numbers between two integers `a` and `b` (inclusive) have a cube that ends in either 4 or 9.

### 7_3_2_calculate_sum_of_numbers

This program calculates the sum of `n` integers, where `n` is provided by the user.

### 7_3_3_evaluate_expression

This program calculates the value of the expression `(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) - ln(n)` for a given natural number `n`.

### 7_3_4_sum_of_numbers_with_special_squares

This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) whose square ends in 2, 5, or 8.

### 7_3_5_factorial

This program calculates the factorial of a given natural number `n`, denoted as `n!`.

### 7_3_6_multiply_non_zero_numbers

This program reads 10 integers from the user and calculates the product of all non-zero numbers.

### 7_3_7_sum_of_divisors

This program calculates the sum of all divisors of a given natural number `n`.

### 7_3_8_alternating_sum

This program calculates the alternating sum of a sequence of natural numbers from 1 to `n`, where the sum alternates between addition and subtraction.

### 7_3_9_find_largest_and_second_largest

This program reads a sequence of `n` natural numbers and calculates the largest and second largest numbers in the sequence.

### 7_3_10_check_all_even

This program reads a sequence of 10 integers and checks if all of them are even.

### 7_3_11_fibonacci_sequence

This program reads a natural number `n` and prints the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This collection of tasks is designed to help solidify core programming skills.
By working on these common scenarios, I will improve your ability to solve real-world problems with Python and get more comfortable with essential programming techniques such as loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.
