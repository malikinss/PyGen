# Fibonacci Sequence Printer

## Description 📝

This program reads a natural number `n` and prints the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 1 and 1.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to display the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
It's commonly used to demonstrate sequence generation and recursion concepts in programming.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program initializes the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, `a` and `b`, as 1 and 1.
2. If `n` is 1, it prints only the first Fibonacci number (1).
3. For larger values of `n`, the program iteratively prints each number in the sequence by updating `a` and `b` with the next values in the Fibonacci series.
4. It outputs the sequence in a single line, followed by a newline.

## Output 📜

The program will output the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Examples:

### Example 1

```shell
Input: 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: 10
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter a natural number `n` to specify how many Fibonacci numbers to print.
3. The program will output the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a straightforward way to generate and print the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, demonstrating iteration and sequence generation.
