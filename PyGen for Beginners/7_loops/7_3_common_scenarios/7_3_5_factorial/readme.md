# Factorial Calculator

## Description 📝

This program calculates the factorial of a given natural number `n`. The factorial of a number `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`.
It is commonly used in combinatorics, probability, and many other fields of mathematics.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to compute the factorial of a number efficiently and demonstrate basic control structures in Python, such as loops and conditionals.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user inputs a natural number `n`.
2. The program calculates `n!` by multiplying all integers from 1 to `n`.
3. If `n` is 0, the program returns 1, as `0!` is defined to be 1.
4. The program outputs the result.

## Output 📜

The output is the factorial of the input number `n`.

For example:

```bash
Input: 5
Output: 120
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input a natural number `n`.
3. The program will calculate and print the factorial of `n`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to compute the factorial of a number using an iterative approach and basic Python constructs.
It's a simple yet important function in mathematics and programming.
