# Sum of Numbers with Special Squares

## Description 📝

This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) whose square ends in 2, 5, or 8.
If no such numbers exist in the specified range, it outputs 0.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to practice basic number operations, such as squaring numbers and checking for specific conditions, in Python.
It also demonstrates how to filter numbers based on the last digit of their square.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user inputs a natural number `n`.
2. The program iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. For each number, it squares the number and checks if the last digit of the square is 2, 5, or 8.
4. If the condition is met, the number is added to a running total.
5. The program outputs the final sum of numbers whose squares end in 2, 5, or 8.

## Output 📜

The output is the sum of the numbers whose squares end in 2, 5, or 8. If there are no such numbers in the given range, the program outputs `0`.

For example:

```bash
Input: 10
Output: 10
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input a natural number `n`.
3. The program will calculate and print the sum of numbers whose square ends in 2, 5, or 8.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program offers a practical example of filtering numbers based on properties of their squares, reinforcing basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.
