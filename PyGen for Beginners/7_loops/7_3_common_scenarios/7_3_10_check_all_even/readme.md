# Check If All Numbers Are Even

## Description 📝

This program reads a sequence of 10 integers and checks if all of them are even.
If all numbers are even, the program outputs "YES".
If at least one number is odd, the program outputs "NO".

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to quickly check whether all the numbers in a given sequence are even or not.
It can be used in scenarios where data validation or checking for specific patterns (like all even numbers) is necessary.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program reads 10 integers from the user, one by one.
2. It checks each number to see if it's even (i.e., divisible by 2).
3. If any of the numbers is odd, the program prints "NO" and stops further checks.
4. If all numbers are even, the program prints "YES".

## Output 📜

-   If all numbers are even, the program prints: `YES`
-   If any number is odd, the program prints: `NO`

Example:

```bash
Input: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
Output: YES

Input: 2 3 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
Output: NO

```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter 10 integers, one per line.
3. The program will output "YES" if all numbers are even, or "NO" if any number is odd.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple solution for validating whether a list of integers consists entirely of even numbers.
It is efficient and easy to implement for sequences of a fixed length.
