# Lesson 7.5: Working with the `while` Loop to Process Digits of a Number 🔢

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on using the `while` loop to process and manipulate the digits of a natural number.
It includes tasks that require extracting digits, reversing numbers, comparing digits, and calculating properties of numbers using the `while` loop.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to understand how to manipulate the digits of a natural number by leveraging the `while` loop.
The tasks help develop skills in processing digits and performing mathematical operations on numbers.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will:

-   Implement programs that extract digits from a number using the `while` loop.
-   Learn how to reverse numbers, find maximum and minimum digits, and check properties of numbers through digit manipulation.
-   Practice using division and modulo operations in the context of loops to solve various problems.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.5.1 Print Digits in Reverse Order

This Python program takes a natural number as input and prints each of its digits in reverse order, with each digit displayed on a new line.
It extracts the last digit of the number and continues until there are no more digits left.

### 7.5.2 Reverse the Digits of a Number

This Python program takes a natural number as input and reverses the order of its digits.
The program processes each digit and builds the reversed number step by step.

### 7.5.3 Find the Maximum and Minimum Digits

This Python program takes a natural number `n` (where n ≥ 10) and determines its maximum and minimum digits by processing each digit and comparing them.

### 7.5.4 Calculate Number Properties

This Python program takes a natural number as input and calculates several properties of the number, such as the sum of its digits, the number of digits, the product of its digits, the arithmetic mean of its digits, the first digit, and the sum of its first and last digits.

### 7.5.5 Find the Second Digit

This Python program takes a natural number `n` (where `n > 9`) and returns the second digit from the left.
It reduces the number and extracts the desired digit using integer division and modulo operations.

### 7.5.6 Check for Identical Digits

This Python program checks if all digits in a given natural number are the same.
It compares the extracted digits, and if all digits are identical, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO".

### 7.5.7 Check for Non-Decreasing Order of Digits

This Python program checks if the digits of a given natural number are in non-decreasing order when viewed from right to left.
It outputs "YES" if the digits form a non-decreasing sequence when reversed, and "NO" otherwise.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson helps solidify the concept of using the `while` loop for digit manipulation in a number.
By mastering these tasks, I can perform various operations on numbers and gain deeper insights into their structure and properties.
