# Calculate Number Properties

## Description 📝

This program takes a natural number as input and calculates several properties of the number.
These properties include the sum of its digits, the number of digits, the product of its digits, the arithmetic mean of its digits, the first digit, and the sum of its first and last digits.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to perform various calculations on a given natural number, providing insights into its digits.
It demonstrates how to extract and process digits from a number using basic mathematical operations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts a natural number `n` as input.
2. It initializes variables for the sum of digits, digit count, digit product, first and last digits, and other properties.
3. Using a while loop, the program processes each digit of the number:
    - It adds each digit to the sum.
    - It counts the digits.
    - It multiplies the digits together.
    - It stores the first and last digits for specific calculations.
4. After processing all digits, the program calculates the arithmetic mean of the digits and the sum of the first and last digits.
5. Finally, it returns the calculated properties.

### Example

```bash
Input: 2857
Output:
Sum of digits: 22
Number of digits: 4
Product of digits: 280
Arithmetic mean: 5.5
First digit: 2
Sum of first and last digits: 9

```

In this example:

-   The sum of the digits is 22.
-   The number has 4 digits.
-   The product of the digits is 280.
-   The arithmetic mean of the digits is 5.5.
-   The first digit is 2.
-   The sum of the first and last digits is 9.

## Output 📜

The program outputs the following:

-   The sum of the digits.
-   The number of digits.
-   The product of the digits.
-   The arithmetic mean of the digits.
-   The first digit.
-   The sum of the first and last digits.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter a natural number `n`.
3. The program will output the properties of the number.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to work with a number's digits to calculate various properties, offering insights such as the sum, product, and average of its digits, as well as the first and last digits.
