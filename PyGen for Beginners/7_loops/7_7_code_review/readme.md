# Lesson 7.7: Code Review 🔍

## Description 📝

This lesson is focused on reviewing code, identifying errors, and analyzing code performance.
Through a series of tasks, learners will practice debugging, improving code functionality, and optimizing performance.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to develop skills for effective code review, error detection, and performance analysis.
Students will learn how to identify and fix bugs, analyze the logic behind algorithms, and ensure the correctness and efficiency of programs.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, you will:

-   Review and debug code snippets with logical and runtime errors.
-   Optimize the performance of programs through better logic and structures.
-   Learn how to identify edge cases and handle them effectively.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.7.1 Count Non-Negative Numbers and Calculate Product

This program processes a sequence of 10 integers to:

-   Count non-negative numbers.
-   Calculate the product of these numbers.
-   Handle edge cases with no non-negative numbers.

### 7.7.2 Sum and Maximum of Negative Numbers

This task involves processing a sequence of 10 integers to:

-   Sum all negative numbers.
-   Identify the maximum negative number.
-   Handle cases with no negative numbers.

### 7.7.3 Sum of Even Numbers

This program calculates the sum of all even numbers in a sequence of 7 integers and ensures the result is 0 if no even numbers are present.

### 7.7.4 Largest Digit Divisible by 3

This task focuses on finding the largest digit in a number that is divisible by 3.
Learners are tasked with debugging and fixing errors in the original implementation.

### 7.7.5 Extract the First Digit of a Number

This program extracts the first (highest) digit of a natural number.
The task requires identifying and correcting errors in the original code.

### 7.7.6 Product of Digits

This program calculates the product of all digits in a natural number.
The challenge involves fixing logical errors and ensuring the program works correctly.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson provides hands-on experience with code review and debugging.
