# Lesson 7.8: Nested Loops 🔄

## Description 📝

This lesson explores the concept of nested loops, where one loop runs inside another.
It also covers the use of `break` and `continue` operators within nested loops and applies these concepts to solve various practical tasks.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Understand how to implement and manage nested loops effectively.
-   Learn to use `break` and `continue` operators to control loop execution.
-   Solve real-world problems using nested loops.

## How It Works 🔍

This lesson introduces nested loops and demonstrates their practical applications through tasks such as generating tables, creating patterns, and handling numerical operations.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.8.1 Print \( n \times 3 \) Table

This program generates a table with \( n \) rows and 3 columns, where each cell contains the number \( n \).
Each row displays the same number three times, separated by spaces.

### 7.8.2 Print \( n \times 5 \) Table

This program generates a table with \( n \) rows and 5 columns.
Each row contains the row number repeated 5 times.

### 7.8.3 Print Addition Table

This program generates an addition table for numbers from 1 to \( n \), where \( n \leq 9 \).
Each cell shows the result of adding the row and column numbers, displayed in the format "i + j = result".

### 7.8.4 Print Isosceles Triangle

This program prints an isosceles star triangle with an odd natural number \( n \) as its base and height.
The triangle is centered and symmetrical, with stars increasing to the middle row and decreasing after.

### 7.8.5 Print Numerical Triangle

This program creates a numerical triangle, where the number in each row corresponds to the row number, repeated as many times as its position in the triangle. For example, row 1 contains '1', row 2 contains '2 2', and so on.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson demonstrates the power of nested loops for generating complex patterns and solving iterative problems.
By completing the tasks, learners gain a strong understanding of nested loop structures and their practical applications.
