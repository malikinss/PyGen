# Lesson 7.2: Working with the `for` Loop and `range()` Function 🔢

## Description 📝

This lesson focused on the `for` loop, specifically the `range()` function, which generates sequences of numbers.
I explored two additional variations of the `range()` function that allow customization of the sequence elements.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson was to deepen my understanding of how the `for` loop and the `range()` function work in Python, and to learn how to manipulate number sequences for various tasks such as iteration, number series generation, and more.

## How It Works 🔍

During this lesson, I:

-   Learned how to generate numeric sequences using the `range()` function.
-   Explored different ways of iterating through numbers, including ascending and descending order.
-   Worked on tasks that involved filtering numbers based on specific conditions and generating multiplication tables.

## Tasks 📜

### 7.2.1 Print Numbers in Range

This program prints all integers between two given numbers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), where the condition `m ≤ n` holds. It is useful for displaying sequences of numbers for purposes such as debugging, number series generation, or educational demonstrations.

### 7.2.2 Print Numbers in Range (Ascending/Descending)

This program prints all integers between two given numbers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), either in ascending or descending order, depending on the relationship between `m` and `n`. If `m < n`, the numbers are printed in ascending order; otherwise, they are printed in descending order.

### 7.2.3 Print Odd Numbers in Descending Order

This program prints all odd numbers between two given integers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), in descending order.
The program ensures that `m > n` and iterates through the range to print only the odd numbers.

### 7.2.4 Print Special Numbers

This program prints all numbers between two given integers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:

-   The number is divisible by 17 without a remainder.
-   The number ends in 9.
-   The number is divisible by both 3 and 5 without a remainder.

### 7.2.5 Print Multiplication Table

This program prints the multiplication table for a given natural number `n`, covering the range from 1 to 10.
It displays each multiplication result in the format `n x i = result`, where `i` is the multiplier from 1 to 10.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson helped me deepen my understanding of working with the `for` loop and the `range()` function in Python to generate numeric sequences and perform various tasks.
Mastery of these concepts will allow me to use loops and iterators more effectively in Python.
