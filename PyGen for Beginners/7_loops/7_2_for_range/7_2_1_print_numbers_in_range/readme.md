# Number Range Printer 🔢

## Description 📝

This program prints all integers between two given numbers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), where the condition `m ≤ n` holds.
It helps to display sequences of numbers for various purposes such as debugging, number series generation, or educational demonstrations.

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to generate and print a sequence of numbers between two user-defined integers.
It ensures that the starting number is less than or equal to the ending number.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts two inputs from the user:
    - `m`: The starting number of the sequence.
    - `n`: The ending number of the sequence.
2. It checks if `m ≤ n`. If not, it returns an error message.
3. If the condition holds true, it prints each number between `m` and `n`, inclusive.

## Output 📜

The output will display each number from `m` to `n` on a new line.
For example:

```bash
Enter the starting number (m): 3
Enter the ending number (n): 7
3 4 5 6 7
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the starting number (`m`).
3. Enter the ending number (`n`).
4. The program will print all numbers from `m` to `n` inclusive.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple way to print a sequence of numbers in a given range, making it useful for generating number series or demonstrating basic control flow in programming.
