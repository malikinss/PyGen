# Multiplication Table Printer 🧮

## Description 📝

This program prints the multiplication table for a given natural number `n`, covering the range from 1 to 10.
It displays each multiplication result in the format `n x i = result`, where `i` is the multiplier from 1 to 10.

## Purpose 🎯

This program is designed to generate and display the multiplication table for any natural number `n`.
It’s a basic program useful for learning how to handle loops and arithmetic operations in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program asks the user to input a natural number `n`.
2. It then iterates through the numbers 1 to 10, multiplying `n` by each number.
3. The program prints each result in the format `n x i = result`.

## Output 📜

For a given number `n`, the program will print the multiplication table from 1 to 10. For example, if `n = 5`:

```bash
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter a natural number `n` for which you want the multiplication table.
3. The program will print the multiplication table for `n` from 1 to 10.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple way to generate and display multiplication tables.
It’s a good exercise for beginners learning how to work with loops and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
