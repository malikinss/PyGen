# Special Numbers Printer (Divisible by 17, Ends in 9, Divisible by 3 and 5) 🔢

## Description 📝

This program prints all numbers between two given integers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:

-   The number is divisible by 17 without a remainder.
-   The number ends in 9.
-   The number is divisible by both 3 and 5 without a remainder.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to identify and print numbers that meet specific divisibility or pattern criteria.
This is useful for demonstrating the use of conditional statements and number analysis in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes two integers, `m` and `n`, as input.
2. It checks all numbers in the range from `m` to `n` and prints the number if it meets at least one of the following conditions:
    - Divisible by 17 without a remainder.
    - Ends in the digit 9.
    - Divisible by both 3 and 5 without a remainder.

## Output 📜

The program will print numbers that satisfy any of the above conditions.
For example:

### If `m = 1` and `n = 50`:

`9 15 17 19 27 30 34 39 45 48`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the starting number (`m`).
3. Enter the ending number (`n`).
4. The program will print all numbers from `m` to `n` that meet the specified conditions.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the use of conditions and loops to filter and print numbers based on specific criteria.
It’s a good example of applying basic number theory in Python.
