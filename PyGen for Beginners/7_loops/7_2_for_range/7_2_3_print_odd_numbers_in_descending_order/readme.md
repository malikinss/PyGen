# Odd Numbers Printer in Descending Order 🔢

## Description 📝

This program prints all odd numbers between two given integers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), in descending order.
The program ensures that `m > n` and iterates through the range to print only the odd numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

This program is designed to find and print all odd numbers between two given numbers, starting from `m` and going down to `n`.
The program guarantees that only odd numbers are printed in descending order, making it useful for numerical analysis and demonstrations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes two inputs from the user:
    - `m`: The starting number.
    - `n`: The ending number.
2. It checks if `m > n` as the program requires descending order.
3. The program then iterates from `m` to `n` in descending order and prints only the odd numbers.

## Output 📜

The program will print all odd numbers between `m` and `n` in descending order. For example:

### If `m = 15` and `n = 5`:

`15 13 11 9 7 5`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the starting number (`m`).
3. Enter the ending number (`n`).
4. The program will print all odd numbers from `m` to `n` in descending order.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple and efficient way to print all odd numbers within a given range in descending order.
It’s useful for generating specific sequences of numbers and understanding basic loops and conditionals in Python.
