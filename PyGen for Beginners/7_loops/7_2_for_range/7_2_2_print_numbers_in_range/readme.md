# Number Range Printer (Ascending or Descending) 🔢

## Description 📝

This program prints all integers between two given numbers, `m` and `n` (inclusive), either in ascending or descending order, depending on the relationship between `m` and `n`. If `m < n`, the numbers are printed in ascending order, otherwise, they are printed in descending order.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to generate and print a sequence of numbers between two user-defined integers in the correct order based on whether the starting number is smaller than the ending number or not.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts two inputs from the user:
    - `m`: The starting number of the sequence.
    - `n`: The ending number of the sequence.
2. If `m < n`, the program prints the numbers in ascending order.
3. If `m ≥ n`, the program prints the numbers in descending order.

## Output 📜

The output will display the numbers in either ascending or descending order, depending on the input. For example:

### If `m = 3` and `n = 7`:

`3 4 5 6 7`

### If `m = 7` and `n = 3`:

`7 6 5 4 3`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the starting number (`m`).
3. Enter the ending number (`n`).
4. The program will print all numbers from `m` to `n`, either in ascending or descending order.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple tool for printing numbers in a specific range in either ascending or descending order, demonstrating basic control flow and input handling in Python.
