# Lesson 7.4: The `while` Loop üîÅ

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on the `while` loop, a control structure used to repeat a set of actions as long as a specific condition holds true.
In this lesson, I will create programs that continuously execute until a certain stopping condition is met, including handling user inputs until a specific keyword or value is encountered.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to develop a deeper understanding of the `while` loop by solving practical problems where repetitive tasks are needed, and the termination of the loop depends on specific conditions.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will:

-   Learn how to use the `while` loop to repeatedly execute code while a condition remains true.
-   Explore how to handle user input dynamically, stopping when a specific condition is met.
-   Understand how to break the loop based on specific values or keywords entered by the user.

## Tasks üìú

### 7.4.1 Print Sequence Until "END"

This program reads a sequence of words from the user, one per line, and stops reading when the word "END" is entered.
The program prints each word in the sequence, excluding "END" itself, which only marks the end of input.

### 7.4.2 Print Sequence Until Keywords

This program reads a sequence of words entered by the user, stopping when either `"END"` or `"end"` is entered.
It prints each word in the sequence, excluding the keywords `"END"` and `"end"` themselves, which only indicate the end of the sequence.

### 7.4.3 Count Terms Until Keywords

This program reads a sequence of words from user input and counts the number of words entered until a specific keyword is encountered.
The program stops counting when one of the keywords `"stop"`, `"enough"`, or `"sufficiently"` is entered.
These keywords act as termination signals and are not included in the count.

### 7.4.4 Print Sequence of Sevens

This program reads a sequence of integers from user input and prints each integer that is divisible by 7.
The sequence ends when a number not divisible by 7 is entered. This last number is used as an exit condition and is not printed.

### 7.4.5 Sum Sequence Until Negative

This program reads a sequence of integers from user input and calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in the sequence.
The sequence ends when a negative integer is entered, which signals termination but is not included in the sum.

### 7.4.6 Count Fives

This program reads a sequence of student grades (integers from 1 to 5) entered by the user and counts how many times the grade 5 appears.
The sequence ends when a negative number or a number greater than 5 is entered, signaling termination without being counted.

### 7.4.7 Minimum Coins

This program determines the minimum number of minted coins needed to reach a specific amount.
The denominations available are 1, 5, 10, and 25.
The program calculates how many coins of these denominations are needed to form a given amount, ensuring the fewest number of coins are used.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson helps deepen the understanding of how `while` loops work, allowing for repeated actions until a specific condition is met.
Mastering `while` loops is essential for handling real-time user input and solving practical problems involving repeated tasks and conditions.
