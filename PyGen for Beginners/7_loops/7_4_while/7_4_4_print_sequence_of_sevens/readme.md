# Print Sequence of Numbers Divisible by 7

## Description 📝

This program reads a sequence of integers from user input and prints each integer that is divisible by 7. The sequence ends when a number not divisible by 7 is entered. This last number is used as an exit condition and is not printed.

## Purpose 🎯

This program demonstrates conditional looping, where input is processed and printed as long as it meets a specific condition (divisibility by 7). It efficiently handles termination based on an unmet condition.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program enters a loop to continuously read integer input from the user.
2. For each integer, it checks if the number is divisible by 7.
3. If the integer is divisible by 7, the program prints it.
4. If the integer is not divisible by 7, the loop breaks, stopping further input and printing.

## Output 📜

The output is a sequence of integers, each divisible by 7, printed on a new line.

### Example

```bash
Input: 14 21 28 33
Output: 14 21 28

```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter integers one at a time.
3. The program will print each integer divisible by 7 until a non-divisible integer is entered, which will end the sequence.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program effectively uses a condition-controlled loop to filter and display numbers meeting specific divisibility criteria, showcasing basic control flow and input handling in Python.
