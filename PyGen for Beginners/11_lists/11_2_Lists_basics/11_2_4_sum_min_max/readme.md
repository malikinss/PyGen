# Sum of Minimum and Maximum Elements in List 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program calculates and displays the sum of the minimum and maximum elements from a list of floating-point numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to find the minimum and maximum values in a list and compute their sum using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `sum_min_max()` takes a list of floating-point numbers as input.
2. It uses the `min()` function to find the smallest number and the `max()` function to find the largest number in the list.
3. It calculates the sum of these two values and returns it.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input: [12.5, 3.1415, 2.718, 9.8, 1.414, 1.1618, 1.324]
Example Output: 13.9
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `sum_min_max.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. View the calculated sum of the minimum and maximum numbers in the list.

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal or Python IDE.
2. Execute the script using python `sum_min_max.py`.
3. View the result in the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple example of how to work with lists and find minimum and maximum values, demonstrating the utility of Python's built-in functions.
