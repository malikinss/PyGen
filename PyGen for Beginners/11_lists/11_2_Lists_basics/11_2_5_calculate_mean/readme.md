# Arithmetic Mean of Even Numbers 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program calculates the arithmetic mean of the elements in a list of even numbers. It defines a function `calculate_mean()` that takes a list of integers and returns the mean value.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to calculate the arithmetic mean of a list using Python's built-in `sum()` function and basic arithmetic operations. It also showcases the use of typing hints with the `List[int]` annotation.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `calculate_mean()` accepts a list of integers as input.
2. It calculates the sum of the list elements using `sum()`.
3. It divides the sum by the length of the list to compute the mean and returns the result.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
Example Output: 11.0
```

## Usage 📦

Save the script as `mean_of_evens.py`.
Run the script in a Python environment.
View the calculated arithmetic mean of the even numbers list.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program shows a simple and effective method to compute the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.
It demonstrates the power of Python's built-in functions and how to handle lists efficiently.
