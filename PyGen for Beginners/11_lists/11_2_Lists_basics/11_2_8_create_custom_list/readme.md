# Create Custom List Using Concatenation and Multiplication 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program creates a custom list by using list concatenation (`+`) and list multiplication (`*`). The function `create_custom_list()` takes three lists as input and combines them into a single list with specific rules.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to manipulate lists using both concatenation and multiplication operators. It helps understand how to repeat and merge lists to create a custom structure.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `create_custom_list()` takes three lists as input.
2. It repeats the first list (`numbers1`) twice using the multiplication operator (`* 2`).
3. It repeats the second list (`numbers2`) nine times using the multiplication operator (`* 9`).
4. It concatenates the results of the previous two operations with the third list (`numbers3`), which is added as is.
5. It returns the final concatenated and multiplied list.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]
numbers2 = [6]
numbers3 = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

Example Output:
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `create_custom_list.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. View the created custom list based on the defined rules.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program illustrates how to use list concatenation and multiplication in Python to create a customized list based on specific patterns, demonstrating the power and flexibility of list operations in Python.
