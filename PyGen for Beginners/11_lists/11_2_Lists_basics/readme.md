# Lesson 11.2: Basics of Working with Lists üìù

## Description üìù

This lesson covers the basics of working with lists in Python, including the use of built-in functions and operators.
I will learn how to access elements of a list using indexing, slice a list, and use Python's built-in functions such as `len()`, `sum()`, `min()`, and `max()`.
The lesson also explores how to manipulate lists using concatenation, multiplication, and how they differ from strings.
By the end of this lesson, I will be comfortable using lists to store, access, and modify ordered data.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to:

1. Introduce basic list operations such as indexing, slicing, and modifying lists.
2. Explain how to use built-in functions (`len()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`) for working with lists.
3. Demonstrate how to use the `in` operator to check for membership.
4. Teach how to perform operations like concatenation and repetition on lists.
5. Clarify the differences between lists and strings in Python.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will:

-   Learn how to perform basic operations on lists such as indexing, slicing, and membership testing.
-   Understand how to use built-in functions to compute properties of a list.
-   Work with lists of various types and manipulate them using Python's list operators.
-   Understand the differences between lists and strings, especially in terms of mutability and functionality.

## Tasks üìú

### 11.2.1 Code Review Task

-   This task updates a Python script to print the 17th element of a list of prime numbers, considering the 1-based index. It demonstrates how to access list elements using an index and adjust for 0-based indexing.

### 11.2.2 Code Review Task

-   This task updates a Python script to print the last element of the `primes` list using negative indexing. It demonstrates how to use `-1` to refer to the last item in a list.

### 11.2.3 Code Review Task

-   This task extends the previous Python script to output the first 6 elements of the `primes` list using slicing. It demonstrates how to extract a portion of a list using slicing.

### 11.2.4 Sum, Min, Max

-   This Python program calculates and displays the sum of the minimum and maximum elements from a list of floating-point numbers. It uses Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to achieve this.

### 11.2.5 Calculate Mean

-   This Python program calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of even numbers using the `sum()` function and basic arithmetic operations. It defines a function `calculate_mean()` that returns the mean value and demonstrates typing hints (`List[int]`).

### 11.2.6 Replace Colors

-   This Python program replaces "Green" with "Pink" and "Violet" with "Grey" in a predefined list of rainbow colors. It demonstrates how to access and modify specific list elements based on index positions.

### 11.2.7 Reverse List

-   This Python program reverses the order of elements in a list of languages. It defines the function `reverse_list()` that takes a list and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order using Python's slicing technique (`[::-1]`).

### 11.2.8 Create Custom List

-   This Python program creates a custom list by using list concatenation (`+`) and list multiplication (`*`). The function `create_custom_list()` combines multiple lists based on specific rules, demonstrating list manipulation.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I will have a strong foundation in working with lists in Python.
I will understand how to create, access, modify, and manipulate lists using Python's powerful built-in functions and operators.
Lists are one of the most important data structures in Python, and mastering them will greatly enhance my ability to manage data effectively in my programs.
