# Lesson 11.6: List Methods (Part 2) 📋

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on advanced list manipulation techniques in Python.
Through five practical tasks, I will enhance my skills in modifying, sorting, and processing lists, as well as handling text-based data.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Strengthen understanding of list operations in Python.
-   Apply list methods to solve real-world problems.
-   Develop familiarity with common text and data manipulation techniques.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson is divided into five tasks, each targeting a specific list operation or text processing challenge. Each script demonstrates the application of list methods and string operations to solve practical problems.

## Tasks 📜

### 11_6_1 Modify List

Modify a list of integers by replacing, extending, deleting, duplicating, and inserting elements at specific positions.

### 11_6_2 Swap Min and Max Elements

Swap the smallest and largest elements in a list derived from space-separated integers.

### 11_6_3 Count Articles

Count the occurrences of articles ('a', 'an', 'the') in a given string of text.

### 11_6_4 Remove Comments

Remove all comments (text following `#`) from a list of Python code lines, preserving the code.

### 11_6_5 Sort and Print

Sort a list of integers in both ascending and descending order and print the results.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `11_6_lists_methods_2` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 11_6_1_modify_list.py
    python 11_6_2_swap_min_max_elements.py
    python 11_6_3_count_articles.py
    python 11_6_4_remove_comments.py
    python 11_6_5_sort_and_print.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts and observe the results in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with list operations and string manipulations, reinforcing essential Python skills for handling data and text.  
Keep practicing and experimenting with different inputs to deepen your understanding! 🚀✨
