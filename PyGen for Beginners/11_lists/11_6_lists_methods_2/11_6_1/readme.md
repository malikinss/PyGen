# List Modification Script 📝

## Description 📝

This Python script performs a series of modifications on a given list of integers. The modifications include replacing elements, extending the list, removing elements, duplicating the list, and inserting new elements at specific positions.

## Purpose 🎯

The script demonstrates various list manipulation techniques in Python, including:

-   Replacing elements by index.
-   Appending multiple elements.
-   Deleting elements.
-   Doubling a list.
-   Inserting elements at specific positions.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Input:** The program starts with a predefined list of integers: `[8, 9, 10, 11]`.
2. **Operations:**
    - Replace the second element with `17`.
    - Append the numbers `[4, 5, 6]` to the end of the list.
    - Remove the first element.
    - Double the list by concatenating it with itself.
    - Insert the number `25` at index `3`.
3. **Output:** The modified list is printed.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Output:
[9, 10, 11, 25, 17, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 25, 17, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `modify_list.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Observe the output, which is the modified list.

## Conclusion 🚀

This script is an excellent example of how to perform various list operations in Python, showcasing methods such as indexing, extending, deleting, duplicating, and inserting elements.
