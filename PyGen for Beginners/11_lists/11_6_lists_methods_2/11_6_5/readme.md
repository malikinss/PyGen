# Sort Numbers in Ascending and Descending Order 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a string of integers as input, converts it into a list, and sorts the list first in ascending order and then in descending order, printing both sorted lists.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to sort a list of integers in both ascending and descending order, showcasing the use of Python's `sorted()` function for sorting lists.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The input string is split into individual integers, which are then converted into a list of integers.
2. The `sort_and_print()` function sorts the list in ascending order using `sorted()`, prints the sorted list.
3. It then sorts the list in descending order by passing the `reverse=True` argument to `sorted()`, and prints the result.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input: 5 3 8 1 2
Example Output:
1 2 3 5 8
8 5 3 2 1
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `sort_numbers.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
4. The script will print the sequence in ascending order followed by the descending order.

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal or Python IDE.
2. Execute the script using python `sort_numbers.py`.
3. Input the sequence of integers when prompted.
4. View the sorted results in the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple example of how to sort a list of integers in both ascending and descending order, utilizing Python's built-in sorting functions for easy and efficient sorting.
