# Count Articles ('a', 'an', 'the') in Text 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program counts the total number of articles (`'a'`, `'an'`, and `'the'`) in a given string of English text.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to process a text string, split it into words, and count specific words (in this case, articles) using basic string and set operations in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `count_articles()` accepts a string of text as input.
2. It converts the text to lowercase and splits it into words using the `split()` method.
3. It checks each word in the list to see if it is an article (`'a'`, `'an'`, or `'the'`), and counts how many times these articles appear.
4. The result is returned as the total count of articles in the text.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog and an apple."
Example Output: 3
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `count_articles.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter an English text when prompted.
4. The script will print the total number of articles in the entered text.

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal or Python IDE.
2. Execute the script using python `count_articles.py`.
3. Enter the text when prompted.
4. View the result in the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple example of how to count specific words (articles) in a text string. It uses basic string manipulation techniques in Python to achieve the desired result.
