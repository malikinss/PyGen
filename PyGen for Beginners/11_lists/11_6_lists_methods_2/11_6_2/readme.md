# Swap Minimum and Maximum Elements in a List 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program swaps the minimum and maximum elements of a list of integers that is parsed from an input string.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to take a string of space-separated natural numbers, form a list from these numbers, and then swap the minimum and maximum elements in the list. The program then prints the modified list.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program reads a string of space-separated natural numbers from the input.
2. The string is converted into a list of integers.
3. The program finds the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the list.
4. The minimum and maximum elements are swapped in the list.
5. Finally, the updated list is printed.
