# Lesson 11.7: List Comprehension in Python 📝

## Description 📝

In this lesson, we will explore various Python tasks that demonstrate the power and simplicity of **list comprehensions**.
Each task focuses on transforming and processing lists in an efficient and readable manner.
You'll apply list comprehension techniques to remove characters from strings, calculate lengths, filter data, and more.
These exercises will improve your understanding of Python's ability to handle complex list operations concisely.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to:

-   Learn how to use list comprehensions to perform operations on lists.
-   Understand filtering, transforming, and manipulating lists with a single line of code.
-   Gain a deeper appreciation for Python's list processing capabilities.

## How It Works 🔍

Each task in this lesson demonstrates a common use case for list comprehension, such as:

-   Removing characters from strings.
-   Calculating lengths of strings.
-   Filtering lists based on specific conditions.
-   Working with integers, strings, and output formatting.

By completing these exercises, you will develop a solid foundation in manipulating lists and strings efficiently.

## Tasks 📜

### 11_7_1 Remove First Character

This task removes the first character from each string in a list of strings. It uses list comprehension to process the list in a concise and efficient manner.

### 11_7_2 Get String Lengths

This task calculates the length of each string in a list and returns a new list of string lengths. It demonstrates how to efficiently map the `len()` function to all items in the list.

### 11_7_3 Filter Keywords

This task filters a list of keywords and returns only those that have at least five characters. It shows how to apply conditional filtering with list comprehension.

### 11_7_4 Find Palindromes

This task identifies palindrome numbers between 100 and 1000. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. It illustrates how to check for palindromes efficiently.

### 11_7_5 Generate Squares

This task generates squares of numbers from `1` to `n`, where `n` is a user-provided input. It demonstrates the creation of sequences using list comprehension.

### 11_7_6 Generate Cubes

This task generates cubes of numbers given as input and prints the results on a single line. It shows how to perform arithmetic operations within a list comprehension.

### 11_7_7 Print Words in Column

This task splits a line of text into individual words and prints each word on a new line. It practices string manipulation and iteration over lists.

### 11_7_8 Extract Numeric Characters

This task extracts numeric characters from a string and concatenates them. It shows how to use the `isdigit()` method for filtering characters.

### 11_7_9 Squares of Even Numbers Not Ending in 4

This task calculates the squares of even numbers that do not end in '4'. It demonstrates filtering and transforming lists with specific criteria.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or copy the required Python files.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/list-comprehension-exercises.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `11_7_list_comprehension` directory.
3. Run the individual Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python 11_7_1_remove_first_character.py
    python 11_7_2_get_string_lengths.py
    python 11_7_3_filter_keywords.py
    python 11_7_4_find_palindromes.py
    python 11_7_5_generate_squares.py
    python 11_7_6_generate_cubes.py
    python 11_7_7_print_words_in_column.py
    python 11_7_8_extract_numeric_characters.py
    python 11_7_9_squares_of_even_numbers_not_ending_in_4.py
    ```
4. Observe the results printed in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

List comprehensions are a powerful tool in Python, enabling concise and efficient data processing.
In this lesson, you learned how to apply list comprehensions for transforming lists, filtering data, and performing calculations.
These techniques are widely used in Python for writing clean, readable code.
