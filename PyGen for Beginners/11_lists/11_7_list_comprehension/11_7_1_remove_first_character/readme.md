# Remove First Character from Strings in List

## Description 📝

This Python program uses a **list comprehension** to create a new list from an existing list of strings.
The program removes the first character from each string in the list, resulting in a modified list where all strings are truncated from the left by one character.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of the program is to:

-   Demonstrate the use of list comprehensions for concise and efficient list transformations.
-   Process a list of Python keywords by removing the first character of each item.
-   Illustrate the power and simplicity of Python's list operations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function Definition**: A function `remove_first_character` accepts a list of strings.
2. **List Comprehension**: A new list is generated by iterating over each string in the original list and slicing it (`s[1:]`), effectively removing the first character.
3. **Execution**: The function is called with a list of Python keywords, and the resulting list is printed.

### Key Points:

-   The program demonstrates Pythonic ways of handling list transformations.
-   The use of list comprehension makes the code more readable and efficient compared to traditional loops.

## Output 📜

The program outputs a list of Python keywords with their first character removed.  
**Example Output:**

```
['alse', 'rue', 'one', 'nd', 'ith', 's', 'ssert', 'reak',
 'lass', 'ontinue', 'ef', 'el', 'lif', 'lse', 'xcept',
 'inally', 'ry', 'or', 'rom', 'lobal', 'f', 'mport', 'n',
 's', 'ambda', 'onlocal', 'ot', 'r', 'ass', 'aise', 'eturn',
 'hile', 'ield']
```

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the code into a file named `remove_first_char.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script by executing:  
   `python remove_first_char.py`
5. The modified list will be printed to the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

List comprehensions are a powerful feature of Python that simplify list transformations.
This project shows how a simple task—removing the first character from each string in a list—can be achieved with minimal code and maximum efficiency.
Mastering list comprehensions enhances the readability and performance of Python programs. 🌟
