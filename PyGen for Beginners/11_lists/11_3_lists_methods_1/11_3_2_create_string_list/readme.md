# Create a List from User-Entered Strings 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program creates a list of strings based on user input. The user first enters the number of strings they wish to input, and then the program collects those strings and stores them in a list.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to interact with the user through input prompts, collect a specific number of strings, and store them in a list. It provides a practical example of list manipulation and user interaction in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program first asks the user for an integer `n`, which represents the number of strings to input.
2. It then prompts the user to enter `n` strings one by one.
3. These strings are collected in a list, which is returned by the function `create_string_list()`.
4. The final list of strings is printed to the console.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
Enter the number of strings: 3
Enter string 1: Apple
Enter string 2: Banana
Enter string 3: Cherry

Example Output:
['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `create_string_list.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter the number of strings you want to input, followed by each string when prompted.
4. View the resulting list of entered strings.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple way to demonstrate user input handling and list creation in Python, offering a practical example for collecting and storing multiple string values dynamically.
