# Create a List of Characters from Strings 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a natural number `n`, followed by `n` strings, and creates a list of characters by combining all the characters from the input strings. The resulting list is then printed out.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to iterate through multiple strings and extract their characters into a unified list. It is useful for string processing tasks that require manipulation of individual characters.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `create_char_list()` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of strings) and `strings` (a list of `n` strings).
2. The function initializes an empty list `char_list`.
3. It then iterates through each string in the list, adding each character to `char_list` using the `extend()` method.
4. Finally, the function returns the list containing all the characters from the strings.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
3
hello
world
python

Example Output:
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', 'p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `create_char_list.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input the number of strings `n`.
4. Input the `n` strings one by one.
5. The program will output a list of characters from all the strings.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates an efficient way to process multiple strings and extract their individual characters. It can be applied in various text processing scenarios.
