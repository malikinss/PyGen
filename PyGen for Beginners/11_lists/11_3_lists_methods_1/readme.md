# Lesson 11.3: Methods for Adding and Removing Elements üéØ

## Description üìù

This lesson covers various methods and techniques for adding and removing elements from a Python list. You will learn how to use:

-   The `append()` method to add an element to the end of the list.
-   The `extend()` method to add all elements from another iterable to the list.
-   The `del` operator to remove elements by their index.

Additionally, the lesson includes a series of tasks aimed at practicing list manipulation techniques, such as modifying a list, removing elements, and extracting specific data.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this lesson is to:

1. Teach how to add and remove elements from lists using Python's built-in methods.
2. Demonstrate how to manipulate lists through slicing and indexing.
3. Provide practical examples of how to work with lists in real-world tasks such as extracting elements, removing items, and performing transformations on data.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, learners will:

-   Practice adding elements to a list using `append()` and `extend()`.
-   Learn how to remove elements by index using the `del` operator.
-   Complete practical tasks that involve manipulating lists to achieve specific goals.

## Tasks üìú

### 11.3.1 Code Review Task

-   This task involves editing the given Python code to:
    1. Display the length of the list `numbers`.
    2. Display the last element of the list.
    3. Display the list in reverse order.
    4. Print `YES` if the list contains the numbers 5 and 17, and `NO` otherwise.
    5. Output a list with the first and last elements removed.

### 11.3.2 Create String List

-   This Python program creates a list of strings based on user input. The user specifies how many strings to input, and the program collects and stores those strings in a list.

### 11.3.3 Generate Letter Sequence

-   This Python program generates a list where each string contains repeated letters. The first string has one 'a', the second has two 'b's, and so on up to 26 'z's.

### 11.3.4 Cubes of Numbers

-   This Python program takes a list of integers and returns a list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input list.

### 11.3.5 Divisors of a Number

-   This Python program finds and returns all divisors of a given number `n` by checking for divisibility.

### 11.3.6 Sum of Neighbors

-   This Python program takes a list of integers and generates a new list where each element is the sum of two consecutive numbers from the original list.

### 11.3.7 Remove Odd Indices

-   This Python program removes all elements from a list that are positioned at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) and prints the modified list.

### 11.3.8 Get K-th Letter

-   This Python program extracts the `k`-th letter from each of the input strings and concatenates them into a single string, which is printed.

### 11.3.9 Create Char List

-   This Python program takes a list of strings and creates a list of characters by combining all the characters from the input strings.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to manipulate lists in Python by adding, removing, and modifying elements. The practical tasks will help solidify the understanding of list operations and empower learners to efficiently work with data in Python.
