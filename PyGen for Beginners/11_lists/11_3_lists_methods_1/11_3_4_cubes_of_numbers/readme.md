# Cubes of Numbers 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a list of integers as input and returns a list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input list.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to work with lists and perform mathematical operations (specifically cubing numbers) using list comprehensions in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `cubes_of_numbers()` takes two parameters:
    - `n`: The number of elements in the list.
    - `numbers`: The list of integers.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the `numbers` list and computes the cube of each number (`num ** 3`).
3. The function returns a new list containing the cubes of the given numbers.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
4
1
2
3
4
Example Output:
[1, 8, 27, 64]
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `cubes_of_numbers.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input the number of integers, followed by the integers themselves.
4. The program will output a list of their cubes.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program showcases how to perform mathematical operations on elements in a list and return a modified list using Python's list comprehension.
