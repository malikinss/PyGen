# Lesson 11.4: Elements of Lists 📋

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on various list manipulation techniques, including filtering, categorizing, and performing mathematical operations on list elements. Through seven practical tasks, students will learn how to process and analyze lists effectively.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Enhance understanding of list operations such as filtering, categorization, and applying functions.
-   Demonstrate how to work with mathematical computations on lists and strings.
-   Develop skills for practical data analysis and text processing tasks using Python.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson is divided into seven tasks, each exploring different aspects of list manipulation, such as removing extremes, categorizing numbers, and searching strings for specific terms.

## Tasks 📜

### 11_4_1 Sum of Squares of List Elements

Calculate and print the sum of the squares of the elements in a list of integers.

### 11_4_2 Compute Function Values

Compute the values of the mathematical function `f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1` for each integer input and output the results.

### 11_4_3 Remove Extremes from List

Remove the smallest and largest values from a list while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

### 11_4_4 Get Unique Strings

Return only the unique strings from a list, preserving the order of their first occurrence.

### 11_4_5 Search Lines

Search a set of input lines for a term and print all lines that contain the search term, case-insensitive.

### 11_4_6 Search Strings with Multiple Queries

Filter a list of strings to match all provided search queries, regardless of case.

### 11_4_7 Categorize Numbers

Categorize a list of integers into three groups: negative, zero, and positive numbers, then print them in the specified order.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `11_4_elements` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 11_4_1_sum_of_squares.py
    python 11_4_2_compute_function_values.py
    python 11_4_3_remove_extremes.py
    python 11_4_4_get_unique_strings.py
    python 11_4_5_search_lines.py
    python 11_4_6_search_strings.py
    python 11_4_7_categorize_numbers.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts and observe the results in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson equips me with essential techniques for manipulating and processing lists in Python.
By mastering these tasks, I will be able to handle various data analysis challenges, from filtering and categorizing data to performing mathematical operations and search queries.
