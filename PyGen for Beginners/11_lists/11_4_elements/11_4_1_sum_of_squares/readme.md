# Sum of Squares of List Elements 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program calculates and prints the sum of the squares of the elements in a given list of integers.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to use list comprehension and the `sum()` function to perform mathematical operations on a list.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `sum_of_squares()` takes a list of integers as input.
2. It calculates the square of each element in the list using a generator expression.
3. The `sum()` function adds up all the squared values.
4. The result, which is the sum of the squares, is returned and printed.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Output:
82736394
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `sum_of_squares.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. The program will compute the sum of the squares of the predefined list of integers and print the result.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple yet powerful example of combining Python's functional programming features with list comprehensions for concise and efficient code.
