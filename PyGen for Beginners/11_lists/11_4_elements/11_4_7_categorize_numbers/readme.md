# Categorize Numbers 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a list of integers and categorizes them into three groups: negative numbers, zeros, and positive numbers. It then prints each group in the order of negative numbers first, followed by zeros, and then positive numbers, while preserving the original input order.

## Purpose 🎯

This program helps organize and display integers in categories. It's useful when you need to analyze the distribution of numbers based on their sign or when performing data classification tasks.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program first reads an integer `n`, representing the number of integers to be entered.
2. Then, it reads the `n` integers into a list.
3. The program categorizes the numbers into three categories:
    - **Negative numbers**: Numbers less than zero.
    - **Zeros**: Numbers that are equal to zero.
    - **Positive numbers**: Numbers greater than zero.
4. Finally, the program prints the numbers in the order: negatives, zeros, and positives, each on a separate line.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
7
-5
0
3
-2
7
0
-1

Example Output:
-5
-2
-1
0
0
3
7
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `categorize_numbers.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input the number `n` (the number of integers to be entered).
4. Enter the integers, one per line.
5. The program will print the integers categorized in the order: negative, zero, positive.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program allows easy classification of integers into three categories and is useful for sorting or processing numbers based on their sign.
