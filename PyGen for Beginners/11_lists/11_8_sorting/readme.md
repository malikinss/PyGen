# Lesson 11.8: Sorting Algorithms 🔢

## Description 📝

This lesson explores fundamental sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Sorting is a key operation in programming, essential for data organization, searching, and optimization tasks. In this lesson, we cover two classical algorithms:

-   Bubble Sort (Optimized)
-   Selection Sort

These algorithms provide insight into sorting logic, efficiency, and optimization techniques.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to:

-   Understand and implement classical sorting algorithms.
-   Learn the differences in performance and use cases between bubble sort and selection sort.
-   Develop an appreciation for algorithm optimization and complexity.

By completing these tasks, I will strengthen my foundational algorithmic skills and enhance my ability to manipulate data effectively.

## How It Works 🔍

The programs in this lesson:

-   Take an unsorted list of integers as input.
-   Apply specific sorting techniques to organize the list in ascending order.
-   Print the sorted list as output.

Each algorithm is explained step by step to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Tasks 📜

### 11_8_1 Bubble Sort

An optimized version of the bubble sort algorithm that reduces unnecessary comparisons by tracking the last exchange position.

### 11_8_2 Selection Sort

A classic selection sort implementation that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted list and places it in the sorted portion.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or copy the required Python files.
2. Navigate to the `11_8_sorting` directory.
3. Run the individual sorting scripts:
    ```bash
    python 11_8_1_bubble_sort.py
    python 11_8_2_selection_sort.py
    ```
4. Observe the sorted list printed in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science.
By implementing these algorithms, I develop problem-solving skills and gain insights into algorithm design and optimization.
