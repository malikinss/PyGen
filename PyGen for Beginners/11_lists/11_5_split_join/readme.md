# Lesson 11.5: Split and Join 📋

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on Python's string manipulation techniques involving splitting and joining operations.
Through seven practical tasks, I will develop my ability to process, analyze, and format strings and lists.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to:

-   Deepen understanding of Python's `split()`, `join()`, and related string methods.
-   Apply string operations to solve real-world formatting and data processing problems.
-   Build confidence in handling text input and transforming it into structured output.

## How It Works 🔍

The lesson is broken down into seven tasks, each focusing on a different use case for splitting and joining strings, handling file paths, validating IP addresses, and visualizing data.

## Tasks 📜

### 11_5_1 Print Words in Column

Split a string into words and print each word on a new line.

### 11_5_2 Print Initials

Extract and print the initials (first letter of each name) from a full name in the format: F.P.S.

### 11_5_3 Parse Windows File Path

Parse and display the components of a Windows file path by splitting it at the backslash (`\`).

### 11_5_4 Draw Bar Chart

Visualize a list of integers as a simple bar chart made of `+` characters, where each integer's value determines the length of the bar.

### 11_5_5 Validate IP Address

Check if a string represents a valid IPv4 address by verifying the format and the range of each segment.

### 11_5_6 Insert Separator

Insert a separator between each character of a given string, allowing for flexible formatting of text.

### 11_5_7 Count Equal Pairs

Count the number of pairs of equal elements in a list created from space-separated integers.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `11_5_split_join` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 11_5_1_print_words_in_column.py
    python 11_5_2_print_initials.py
    python 11_5_3_parse_windows_file_path.py
    python 11_5_4_draw_bar_chart.py
    python 11_5_5_is_valid_ip.py
    python 11_5_6_insert_separator.py
    python 11_5_7_count_equal_pairs.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts and observe the results in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson reinforces string manipulation techniques essential for text processing, data validation, and formatting.
Mastering these tasks will improve my ability to handle textual data efficiently in Python programs.
Keep practicing to become more proficient! 🚀✨
