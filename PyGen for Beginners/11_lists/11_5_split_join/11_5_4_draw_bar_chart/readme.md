# Draw Bar Chart 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a text string containing space-separated integers as input and then draws a simple bar chart. Each integer is represented by a line of '+' characters, where the number of '+' symbols corresponds to the value of the integer.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to provide a visual representation of a set of numbers. This bar chart helps to quickly understand the relative magnitude of each number in the input.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives a string of space-separated integers.
2. For each integer in the string, it generates a bar where the number of '+' symbols corresponds to the integer's value.
3. The bars are displayed one below the other, creating a vertical bar chart.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
3 5 2 6

Example Output:
+++
+++++
++
++++++
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `draw_bar_chart.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input a string of space-separated integers (e.g., `3 5 2 6`).
4. The program will print a bar chart where each integer is represented by '+' characters.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides an easy way to visualize a set of numbers using a simple bar chart. It’s useful for comparing values and quickly understanding data distribution.
