# Insert Separator Between Characters 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program inserts a specified separator between each character of a given string.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to take a string of text and a separator string as input, then insert the separator between each character of the input string. It provides a simple way to format strings by separating the characters with a specific delimiter.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts two inputs: the string of text and the separator string.
2. It inserts the separator between each character of the input string using Python's `join()` method.
3. The resulting string is then printed with the specified separator between each character.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
hello
-

Example Output:
h-e-l-l-o

Example Input:
hello
|

Example Output:
h|e|l|l|o
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `insert_separator.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input a string of text (e.g., `hello`).
4. Input a separator string (e.g., `-`).
5. The program will output the string with the separator inserted between each character.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a flexible way to format strings by inserting a separator between each character. It's useful in various scenarios, such as formatting data or creating readable outputs from raw input.
