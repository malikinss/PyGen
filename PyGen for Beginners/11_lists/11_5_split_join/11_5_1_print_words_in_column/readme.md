# Print Words in Column 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes an input string of text and prints each word on a new line, effectively displaying the words of the string in a column format. It's useful when you want to present words in a readable and organized way, for example, when processing or formatting text data.

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to split an input string into individual words and then print each word on a separate line. This can help in organizing or processing text data where each word needs to be displayed independently.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes a string as input.
2. It splits the string into words using the `split()` method, which divides the string by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
3. It then prints each word on a new line using `print()`.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Example Output:
The
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog
```

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `print_words_in_column.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input a string with multiple words.
4. The program will print each word on a separate line.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple tool to format text, especially useful for applications that require word-based text formatting or when processing text data line by line.
