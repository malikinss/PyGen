# Count Equal Pairs in List 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program counts how many pairs of equal elements exist in a list that is formed from a string of space-separated natural numbers.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to calculate the number of pairs of equal elements in a list created from a text string. A pair is formed when two elements are identical. The program helps in counting how many such pairs are present in the list.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts a string containing space-separated natural numbers.
2. It splits the string into a list of numbers.
3. It compares each pair of elements in the list and counts how many pairs of equal elements exist.
4. The program then prints the total count of equal pairs.

## Output 📜

```bash
Example Input:
1 2 3 2 1 4

Example Output:
3
```

### In this case, there are 3 pairs:

-   `1` with `1`
-   `2` with `2`
-   `1` with `1`

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `count_equal_pairs.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Input a string of natural numbers separated by spaces (e.g., `1 2 3 2 1 4`).
4. The program will output the count of equal pairs.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program efficiently calculates how many pairs of identical elements exist in a list created from a string of natural numbers, which can be useful in problems requiring frequency analysis or comparisons.
