# Lesson 4.3: Nested and Cascading Conditions 🌐

## Description 📝
This lesson explores the use of nested and cascading conditions in programming. 
It focuses on structuring complex decision-making processes to solve various problems effectively.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to develop my skills in using nested conditions and cascading logic to handle more intricate scenarios in programming.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, I will:
- Implement programs that utilize multiple layers of conditions to make decisions.
- Practice classifying and categorizing data based on complex criteria.

## Tasks 📜
### 4.3.1 Flash vs. Zoom
This Python program evaluates whether Flash should accept a race challenge from Zoom based on their respective speeds.

### 4.3.2 Triangle Classification
This Python program classifies a triangle based on the lengths of its sides.

### 4.3.3 Midpoint Finder
This Python program finds the midpoint of three different integers provided by the user.

### 4.3.4 Month Days
This Python program determines the number of days in a given month of a non-leap year.

### 4.3.5 Boxing Category
This Python program helps categorize an amateur boxer based on their weight.

### 4.3.6 Math Operation Handler
This Python program performs basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.

### 4.3.7 Color Blending
This Python program reads the names of two primary colors and determines the resulting secondary color after blending them.

### 4.3.8 Roulette Color Detector
This Python program determines the color of a pocket on a roulette wheel based on the pocket number.

### 4.3.9 Segment Intersection
This Python program finds the intersection of two segments on a number line defined by the endpoints \([a1, b1]\) and \([a2, b2]\).

## Conclusion 🚀
This lesson enhances my ability to manage complex conditions in programming. 
Mastering nested and cascading conditions is crucial for developing sophisticated decision-making algorithms.
