# Flash vs Zoom Race Decision

## Description 📝
This Python program evaluates whether Flash should accept a race challenge from Zoom based on their respective speeds.

## Purpose 🎯
The program's purpose is to help Flash decide if he should accept the race challenge by comparing the speeds of Flash and Zoom.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input two integers:
     - `n`: Zoom's speed.
     - `k`: Flash's speed.
2. **Speed Comparison**:
   - The program compares the two speeds:
     - If Zoom's speed (`n`) is greater than Flash's speed (`k`), it outputs "NO".
     - If Flash's speed (`k`) is greater than Zoom's speed (`n`), it outputs "YES".
     - If both speeds are equal, it outputs "Don't know".
3. **Output**:
   - The program provides a straightforward answer based on the comparison.

## Output 📜
The program outputs:
- "NO" if Zoom is faster.
- "YES" if Flash is faster.
- "Don't know" if their speeds are equal.

### Example:
For input: `10 15` The output will be: `YES`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_3_1_flash_vs_zoom.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_3_1_flash_vs_zoom.py`
5. Enter Zoom's and Flash's speeds when prompted, and the program will display the result.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a simple decision-making tool for Flash, helping him determine whether he should race against Zoom based on their speeds.
