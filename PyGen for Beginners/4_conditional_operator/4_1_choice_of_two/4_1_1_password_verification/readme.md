# Password Verification

## Description 📝
This Python program verifies whether two entered passwords match.
This functionality is commonly used during user registration on websites to ensure that the user has correctly entered their desired password.

## Purpose 🎯
The program helps to verify if a user has correctly entered their password by comparing it with a confirmation password.
This reduces the likelihood of errors during password entry.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a password.
   - The user is prompted again to enter the password confirmation.
2. **Comparison**:
   - The program compares the two entered passwords.
3. **Output**:
   - If the passwords match, the program prints "Password accepted".
   - If the passwords do not match, the program prints "Password not accepted".

## Output 📜
The program outputs a message indicating whether the passwords match or not.

### Example:
For inputs:
    `password123`
    `password123`
The output will be:
    `Password accepted`

For inputs:
    `password123` 
    `pass123`
The output will be:
    `Password not accepted`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_1_password_verification.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_1_password_verification.py`
5. Enter the password and its confirmation when prompted, and the program will display whether the passwords match.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward way to check if two passwords match, which is a critical step in many registration processes to ensure user security.
It demonstrates basic input handling and conditional logic in Python. 😊
