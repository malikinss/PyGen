# Sum of Positive Numbers

## Description 📝
This Python program reads three integers and calculates the sum of only the positive numbers among them.
If no positive numbers are provided, the program outputs 0.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to identify and sum the positive integers from a given set of three numbers.
It ensures that non-positive numbers do not contribute to the sum.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter three integers.
2. **Positive Number Filtering**:
   - Each number is checked to determine if it is positive.
   - Only positive numbers are included in the sum.
   - If a number is not positive, it is treated as 0.
3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total sum of the positive numbers.
4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed to the console.

## Output 📜
The program outputs the sum of the positive numbers.
If there are no positive numbers, it outputs 0.

### Example:
For input:
    `-5`
    `3`
    `0`
The output will be:
    `3`


## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_9_sum_of_positive_numbers.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_9_sum_of_positive_numbers.py`
5. Enter three integers when prompted, and the program will display the sum of the positive numbers.
