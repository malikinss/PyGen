# Four-Digit Number Relationship Checker

## Description 📝
This Python program checks whether a given four-digit number satisfies a specific relationship.
The program determines if the sum of the first and last digits equals the difference between the second and third digits.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to validate a mathematical condition for a four-digit number, which helps in understanding digit manipulation and conditional logic.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a four-digit integer.
2. **Digit Extraction**:
   - The program extracts each digit of the four-digit number.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - The sum of the first and last digits is compared to the difference between the second and third digits.
4. **Output**:
   - If the sum equals the difference, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, the program prints "NO".

## Output 📜
The program outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the given condition.

### Example:
For input:
    `1234`
The output will be:
    `NO`

For input:
    `1225`
The output will be:
    `YES`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `four_digit_relationship_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_3_four_digit_relationship_checker.py`
5. Enter a four-digit number when prompted, and the program will display whether the relationship holds.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively demonstrates how to manipulate and compare digits of a number to validate specific conditions. 
It is a good example of using arithmetic operations and conditional statements in Python.
