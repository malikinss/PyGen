# Arithmetic Progression Check

## Description 📝
This Python program checks whether three given numbers form a consecutive arithmetic progression.
The numbers are considered in the given order.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine if three numbers provided by the user are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter three numbers (in the given order).
2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program calculates the differences between consecutive pairs of numbers.
   - It checks if these differences are equal.
3. **Output**:
   - If the differences are equal, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

## Output 📜
The program outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the three numbers form an arithmetic progression.

### Example:
For input:
    `2`
    `4`
    `6`
The output will be:
    `YES`

For input:
    `1`
    `3`
    `5`
The output will be:
    `YES`

For input:
    `1`
    `2`
    `4`
The output will be:
    `NO`


## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_5_arithmetic_progression_check.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_5_arithmetic_progression_check.py`
5. Enter the three numbers when prompted, and the program will display whether they form an arithmetic progression.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program efficiently determines if three numbers form an arithmetic progression using basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks.
It demonstrates how to work with sequences and simple comparisons in Python.
