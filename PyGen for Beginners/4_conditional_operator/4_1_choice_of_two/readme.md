# Lesson 4.1: Choice of Two 🔄

## Description 📝
This lesson explores decision-making and comparisons in programming.
It focuses on implementing conditional logic to solve various problems involving choices and comparisons.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to enhance my ability to use conditional statements to make decisions and solve problems based on multiple criteria.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, I will:
- Implement programs that verify conditions and make choices based on user input or given criteria.
- Practice checking various conditions such as even/odd numbers, password validation, and age-related access controls.

## Tasks 📜

### 4.1.1 Password Verification
This Python program verifies whether two entered passwords match.

### 4.1.2 Even/Odd Checker
This Python program determines whether a given integer is even or odd.

### 4.1.3 Four-Digit Relationship Checker
This Python program checks whether a given four-digit number satisfies a specific relationship.

### 4.1.4 Age Access Control
This Python program determines whether a user is allowed to access an Internet resource based on their age.

### 4.1.5 Arithmetic Progression Check
This Python program checks whether three given numbers form a consecutive arithmetic progression.

### 4.1.6 Smaller Number Finder
This Python program determines the smaller of two given numbers.

### 4.1.7 Smallest Number Finder
This Python program determines the smallest of four given numbers.

### 4.1.8 Age Group Identifier
This Python program determines the age group of a user based on their age.

### 4.1.9 Sum of Positive Numbers
This Python program reads three integers and calculates the sum of only the positive numbers among them.

## Conclusion 🚀
This lesson reinforces my skills in using conditional logic to solve various programming problems.
Mastery of these concepts is crucial for developing more complex and interactive programs.
