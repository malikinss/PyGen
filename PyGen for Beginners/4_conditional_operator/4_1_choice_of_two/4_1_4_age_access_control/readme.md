# Age-Based Access Control

## Description 📝
This Python program determines whether a user is allowed to access an Internet resource based on their age.
If the user is at least 18 years old, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to implement a simple age verification system to control access to certain resources or content.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter their age.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the user's age is 18 or older.
3. **Output**:
   - If the user's age is 18 or older, the program prints "Access Granted".
   - Otherwise, the program prints "Access Denied".

## Output 📜
The program outputs either "Access Granted" or "Access Denied" based on the user's age.

### Example:
For input:
    `20`
The output will be:
    `Access Granted`

For input:
    `16`
The output will be:
    `Access Denied`


## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_4_age_access_control.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_4_age_access_control.py`
5. Enter the user's age when prompted, and the program will display whether access is granted or denied.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward implementation of age-based access control using simple conditional statements.
It demonstrates basic input handling and decision-making in Python. 😊
