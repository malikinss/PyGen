- Youth
- Maturity
- Old Age

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter their age.
2. **Age Group Determination**:
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to classify the age into one of four predefined categories:
     - Childhood: Age up to 13 (inclusive).
     - Youth: Age from 14 to 24 (inclusive).
     - Maturity: Age from 25 to 59 (inclusive).

### Example:
For input:
    `8`

    `childhood`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_8_age_group_identifier.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_8_age_group_identifier.py`
5. Enter the user's age when prompted, and the program will display the corresponding age group.
