# Even or Odd Number Checker

## Description 📝
This Python program determines whether a given integer is even or odd.
The program uses basic arithmetic operations and conditional logic to make this determination.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to identify if an integer is even or odd. 
This is a fundamental concept in programming and helps in understanding modular arithmetic.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter an integer.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the integer is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
3. **Output**:
   - If the number is divisible by 2, the program prints "Even".
   - If the number is not divisible by 2, the program prints "Odd".

## Output 📜
The program outputs either "Even" or "Odd" depending on the input integer.

### Example:
For input:
    `4`
The output will be:
    `Even`

For input:
    `7`
The output will be:
    `Odd`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_1_2_even_odd_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_1_2_even_odd_checker.py`
5. Enter an integer when prompted, and the program will display whether the number is even or odd.

## Conclusion 🚀
This simple program effectively demonstrates the use of modulus operation and conditional statements to classify integers as even or odd.
It serves as a useful example of basic decision-making in Python. 😊
