# Lesson 4.2: Logical Operations ⚖️

## Description 📝
This lesson focuses on logical operations and their applications in programming.
It covers various logical checks and conditions to solve problems involving relationships and criteria.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to enhance my understanding of logical operations and how they can be applied to make decisions in code.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, you will:
- Implement programs that utilize logical operations to perform various checks.
- Practice creating conditions for number ranges, geometric shapes, and special dates.

## Tasks 📜
### 4.2.1 Range Check
This Python program checks if a given integer is within the range of `-1` to `17`, exclusive of `-1` but inclusive of `17`.

### 4.2.2 Interval Check
This Python program checks if a given integer belongs to specified intervals: `[-∞, -3]` and `[7, +∞]`.

### 4.2.3 Interval Check (Revisited)
This Python program checks if a given integer belongs to the specified intervals: `[-30, -2]` and `[7, 25]`.

### 4.2.4 Beautiful Number Checker
This Python program determines whether a four-digit number is "beautiful."

### 4.2.5 Triangle Checker
This Python program determines whether a non-degenerate triangle can be formed using three positive numbers as its sides.

### 4.2.6 Leap Year Checker
This Python program checks whether a given year is a leap year based on specific rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### 4.2.7 Rook Movement Checker
This Python program determines whether a rook can move from one square to another on a chessboard in a single move.

### 4.2.8 King Movement Checker
This Python program determines whether a king can move from one square to another on a chessboard in a single move.

## Conclusion 🚀
This lessons enhances my skills in applying logical operations to solve programming challenges.
Mastery of these concepts is essential for building effective decision-making processes in my code.
