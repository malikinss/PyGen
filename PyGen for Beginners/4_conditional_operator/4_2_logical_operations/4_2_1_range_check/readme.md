# Range Check Program

## Description 📝
This Python program checks if a given integer is within the range of `-1` to `17`, exclusive of `-1` but inclusive of `17`.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine if an integer falls within a specified range and provide an appropriate message based on this evaluation.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Range Checking**:
   - The integer is checked to determine if it falls between `-1` (exclusive) and `17` (inclusive).
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Belongs to" if the integer is within the specified range.
   - It prints "Does not belong" if the integer is outside the specified range.

## Output 📜
The program outputs whether the entered integer belongs to the specified range or not.

### Example:
For input:`16` The output will be: `Belongs to`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_2_1_range_check.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_2_1_range_check.py`
5. Enter an integer when prompted, and the program will display whether it belongs to the specified range.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program efficiently checks if a number falls within a defined range and demonstrates basic conditional logic in Python.
