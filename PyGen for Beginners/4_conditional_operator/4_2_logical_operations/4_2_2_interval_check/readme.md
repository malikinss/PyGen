# Interval Check Program

## Description 📝
This Python program checks if a given integer belongs to specified intervals: `[-∞, -3]` and `[7, +∞]`.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine if an integer falls within the defined intervals and provide feedback based on the evaluation.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Interval Checking**:
   - The integer is checked to see if it is less than or equal to `-3` or greater than or equal to `7`.
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Belongs to" if the integer is within either of the specified intervals.
   - It prints "Does not belong to" if the integer is outside both intervals.

## Output 📜
The program outputs whether the entered integer belongs to the specified intervals or not.

### Example:
For input: `-4` The output will be: `Belongs to`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `4_2_2_interval_check.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 4_2_2_interval_check.py`
5. Enter an integer when prompted, and the program will display whether it belongs to the specified intervals.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively checks if a number falls within defined intervals and demonstrates basic conditional logic in Python.
