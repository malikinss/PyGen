# Python Program for Mathematical Calculations: Sum of Cubes vs Cube of Sum 🧮

## Description 📝

This Python program clarifies the difference between the **sum of cubes** and the **cube of the sum** for two integers. It calculates and displays both results in a clear and user-friendly format.

## Purpose 🎯

The main purpose of this program is to help students and users distinguish between two commonly confused mathematical concepts:

-   **Sum of cubes:** \( a^3 + b^3 \)
-   **Cube of the sum:** \( (a + b)^3 \)

## How It Works 🔍

The program:

1. Takes two integers as input.
2. Computes:
    - The sum of their cubes.
    - The cube of their sum.
3. Displays the results in a structured format.

## Output 📜

For example, if the input is `2` and `3`:
`For numbers 2 and 3: Sum of cubes: 23 + 33 = 35 Cube of sum: (2 + 3)**3 = 125`

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input two integers when prompted.
3. View the results displayed in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a handy tool for quickly understanding the difference between the **sum of cubes** and the **cube of the sum**, making it ideal for educational purposes or quick calculations!
