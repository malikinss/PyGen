# Guido's Weight Loss Tracker Program 🏋️‍♂️

## Description 📝

This Python program helps Guido monitor his weight loss journey as he aims to shed weight before summer. Guido's target is to lose weight consistently over 60 days, starting at 100 kg and reaching 88 kg or less.

## Purpose 🎯

To ensure that Guido stays on track with his weight loss goal, the program:

1. Calculates the daily weight goal.
2. Compares Guido's current weight with the target weight for the day.
3. Provides feedback on whether his progress is on track.

## How It Works 🔍

1. Guido inputs:
    - The current day (1–60).
    - His current weight.
2. The program computes:
    - The expected weight goal for the given day.
    - Whether Guido's current weight meets the goal.
3. Outputs:
    - A message indicating success or the need for improvement.
    - Detailed information about the day, Guido's current weight, and the weight goal.

## Output 📜

### Examples:

#### Test Case 1

```bash
Input:
Enter the current day (1-60): 1
Enter Guido's current weight: 99
Output:
Everything is going according to plan
#1 DAY: CURRENT WEIGHT = 99.00 kg, WEIGHT GOAL = 99.80 kg
```

#### Test Case 2

```bash
Input:
Enter the current day (1-60): 30
Enter Guido's current weight: 93.5
Output:
Everything is going according to plan
#30 DAY: CURRENT WEIGHT = 93.50 kg, WEIGHT GOAL = 94.00 kg
```

#### Test Case 3

```bash
Input:
Enter the current day (1-60): 45
Enter Guido's current weight: 90.5
Output:
Everything is going according to plan
#30 DAY: CURRENT WEIGHT = 93.50 kg, WEIGHT GOAL = 94.00 kg
```

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Input the current day (1-60).
3. Input Guido's current weight.
4. View the feedback and track progress.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program serves as a motivational tool for Guido to stay on track with his weight loss journey. It provides clear and actionable feedback to help achieve his fitness goals in time for summer!
