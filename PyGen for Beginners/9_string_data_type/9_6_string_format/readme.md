# Lesson 9.6: String Formatting 📝

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on mastering string formatting in Python, specifically using the `format()` method and f-strings.
These tools allow for efficient, dynamic, and readable string construction, which is essential for creating user-friendly outputs in real-world applications.

## Purpose 🎯

To equip learners with the skills to format strings dynamically and cleanly using both traditional and modern Python techniques.
This includes understanding the benefits of each method and learning how to apply them to solve various practical tasks.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, you will:

-   Learn to use the `format()` method for flexible string formatting.
-   Explore f-strings for efficient and readable formatting in Python 3.6+.
-   Apply these techniques to real-world scenarios like financial calculations, mathematical demonstrations, and progress tracking.

## Tasks 📜

### 9.6.1 Code Review Task

-   Uses the `format()` method to construct the string:  
    `"In 2010, someone paid 10k Bitcoin for two pizzas."`
-   Highlights clean and dynamic text formatting.

### 9.6.2 Code Review Task

-   Demonstrates f-string formatting to construct the same string:  
    `"In 2010, someone paid 10K Bitcoin for two pizzas."`
-   Showcases the simplicity and efficiency of f-strings.

### 9.6.3 Exchange Rate

-   Displays exchange rates of USD and CNY to Russian rubles for a given date.
-   Provides user-friendly output for a banking application.

### 9.6.4 Cubes

-   Clarifies the difference between:
    -   Sum of cubes: \( a^3 + b^3 \)
    -   Cube of the sum: \( (a + b)^3 \)
-   Outputs results in a formatted and understandable way.

### 9.6.5 Guido Diet

-   Tracks weight loss progress over 60 days.
-   Calculates daily goals and provides feedback to ensure progress stays on track.

## Conclusion 🚀

String formatting is a fundamental skill in Python that improves the readability and user-friendliness of your programs.
By mastering both the `format()` method and f-strings, you'll be equipped to handle text formatting tasks efficiently in any project.
