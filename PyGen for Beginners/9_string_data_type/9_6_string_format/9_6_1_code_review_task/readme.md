# Code Review Task 🪲

## Description 📝

This task improves a Python script to output a formatted string using the `format` method.
The program formats the string `"In {0}, someone paid {1} {2} for two pizzas."` with specific values to produce:  
`"In 2010, someone paid 10k Bitcoin for two pizzas."`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to:

1. Demonstrate the use of the `format` method for string formatting.
2. Ensure the variables are dynamically inserted into the string.
3. Highlight clean and readable methods for constructing formatted text.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program initializes the string template `s` with placeholders `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}`.
-   It defines variables `year`, `price`, and `value` with respective values.
-   The `format` method replaces the placeholders in the string with the values of the variables.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs:  
    `"In 2010, someone paid 10k Bitcoin for two pizzas."`

## Identified Errors in the Original Code 🕵🏾:

1. **Empty Print Statement**:

    - Original: `print()`
    - Issue: The `print()` function lacks an argument, producing no output.
    - Fix: Add `s.format(year, price, value)` to dynamically format the string and print it.

2. **Missing Variable Definitions**:
    - The original code lacks variable definitions for `year`, `price`, and `value`.
    - Fix: Define these variables and pass them to the `format` method.

## Fixed Code 🛠:

```python
# Define the variables
year = 2010
price = '10k'
value = 'Bitcoin'

# Format the string using the format method
s = 'In {0}, someone paid {1} {2} for two pizzas.'.format(year, price, value)

# Output the formatted string
print(s)  # Outputs 'In 2010, someone paid 10k Bitcoin for two pizzas.'
```

## Explanation of Changes 🧾:

1. **Added variables**: Defined year, price, and value to be used in the string formatting.
2. **Implemented format method**: Used format(year, price, value) to dynamically insert values into the string.
3. **Added comments**: Explained the purpose of the formatting and the variables.

## Conclusion 🚀

This task demonstrates the effective use of the format method to construct a dynamically formatted string.
By fixing the issues, the program now functions as intended, producing clean and accurate output.
