# Lesson 9.4: String Methods (Part 2) 📝

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on Python string methods that facilitate searching, replacing, and manipulating text.
The methods covered include `count()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`, `find()`, `rfind()`, `index()`, `rindex()`, `strip()`, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`, and `replace()`.
These methods are crucial for tasks such as pattern recognition, data cleaning, and text transformation.

## Purpose 🎯

To equip learners with practical knowledge of Python's string manipulation methods, enabling them to efficiently search, modify, and process text data in a variety of applications.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will:

-   Learn about the methods used for finding substrings, counting occurrences, and replacing or stripping characters in strings.
-   Solve real-world tasks requiring the use of these methods for effective text processing.
-   Gain hands-on experience with string-related problem-solving.

## Tasks 📜

### 9.4.1 Count Words

-   Removes the first and last occurrences of the letter **'h'** in a string, including all characters in between.

### 9.4.2 Count Nucleotides

-   Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, G, C, T) in a genetic sequence.

### 9.4.3 Count Messages from Eleven

-   Analyzes Morse code messages to count occurrences of the pattern "11" and checks if it appears at least three times.

### 9.4.4 Count Digits in String

-   Counts the total number of numeric digits (0-9) present in a given string of text.

### 9.4.5 Check Domain

-   Verifies whether a string ends with the domain extensions `.com` or `.co.il`.

### 9.4.6 Most Frequent Character

-   Identifies the character that appears most frequently in a string, resolving ties by returning the last character among those with the highest frequency.

### 9.4.7 Find 'f' Occurrences

-   Determines the positions of the first and last occurrences of the letter **'f'** in a string, printing results based on its frequency.

### 9.4.8 Remove 'h' Between

-   Removes all content between the first and last occurrences of **'h'**, including the occurrences themselves.

## Conclusion 🚀

By completing this lesson, I will develop strong skills in using Python string methods for search, replace, and format tasks.
These methods are essential tools for data preprocessing, text analysis, and general-purpose programming.
