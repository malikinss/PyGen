# Count Nucleotides in Genetic Code 🧬

## Description 📝

This program takes a string representing a genetic code and counts the number of occurrences of each nucleotide: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of the program is to help analyze genetic sequences by counting the occurrences of the four main nucleotides (A, G, C, T). This can be useful for bioinformatics or genetic analysis tasks.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives a string representing a genetic code.
2. It counts how many times each nucleotide (A, G, C, T) appears in the string.
3. It then prints the count of each nucleotide.

### Example:

```bash
Input: AGCTAGCTAG
Output:
Adenine: 3
Guanine: 3
Cytosine: 2
Thymine: 2
```

## Output 📜

The program outputs the count of each nucleotide (A, G, C, T) found in the input genetic code.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple tool for analyzing genetic sequences and counting the four basic nucleotides.
It's useful for anyone working with DNA sequences in bioinformatics.
