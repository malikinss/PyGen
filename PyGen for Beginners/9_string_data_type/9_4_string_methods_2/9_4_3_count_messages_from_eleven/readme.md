# Count Messages from Eleven 📡

## Description 📝

This program helps Jim Hopper count how many messages from Eleven contain the number "11" at least three times. It processes a series of Morse code sequences and checks each one for the frequency of "11".

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of the program is to identify messages from Eleven by counting how many times the sequence "11" appears in each message. This could be used in a situation like Morse code decoding to detect specific patterns.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives a number `n` representing the number of Morse code sequences.
2. It then receives `n` strings of Morse code messages.
3. It counts how many messages contain the number "11" at least three times.
4. It outputs the number of such messages.

### Example:

```bash
Input:
3
111011110111
1111000111
110111100
```

## Output:

2

## Output 📜

The program outputs the number of messages that contain the number "11" at least three times.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program helps detect messages from Eleven in Morse code by counting a specific sequence "11".
It's useful for identifying specific patterns in a set of messages.
