# Remove First and Last "h" and Characters Between 📝

## Description 📝

This program takes an input string containing at least two occurrences of the letter "h". It removes the first and last occurrences of "h", as well as all characters between them.

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of the letter "h" in a string, along with all characters between them. This could be useful for specific string manipulations or text processing where certain characters need to be removed, including everything between them.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program searches for the first and last occurrences of the letter "h" in the string.
2. It then removes all characters between these two occurrences (inclusive of "h").
3. The remaining part of the string is returned.

### Example:

```bash
Input: ahhellohhworld
Output: aworld

Input: hello hthereh world
Output: world
```

## Output 📜

The program outputs the modified string with the first and last "h" removed, as well as all characters between them.

## Conclusion 🚀
