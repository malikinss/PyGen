# Unicode Characters from Code Range 🌐

## Description 📝

This program takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. These integers represent Unicode code points, and the program outputs the characters corresponding to each code point in the range `[a, b]` (inclusive).

## Purpose 🎯

To demonstrate how Unicode code points map to characters and provide a way to visualize characters from a given range of Unicode values.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, as input.
2. It iterates through the range `[a, b]`:
    - For each code point in this range, it converts the code to its corresponding character using Python's `chr()` function.
3. The characters are printed in a single line, separated by spaces.

## Output 📜

### Example:

```bash
Input: 65 70
Output: A B C D E F
```

### Explanation:

-   Unicode code point 65 corresponds to `A`.
-   Unicode code point 66 corresponds to `B`.
-   And so on, until 70, which corresponds to `F`.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Input two integers, `a` and `b` (where `a <= b`).
3. View the characters corresponding to the Unicode code points in the range `[a, b]`.

### Notes:

-   Ensure that `a` and `b` are valid Unicode code points (`0 <= a, b <= 0x10FFFF`).
-   The program does not validate inputs; unexpected results may occur for invalid ranges.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates the power of Unicode and Python's character manipulation tools, offering a practical way to explore the relationship between code points and characters.
