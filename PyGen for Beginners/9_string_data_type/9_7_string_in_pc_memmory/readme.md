# Lesson 9.7: String Representation in Computer Memory 💾

## Description 📝

This lesson explores how strings are represented in computer memory using ASCII and Unicode standards.
It includes functions like `ord()` and `chr()`, which enable the conversion of characters to their respective code points and vice versa.

The tasks focus on various aspects of string manipulation, from finding characters within a range to decoding text corrupted during a system crash. By understanding string representation, I will gain insight into how text is stored, processed, and manipulated programmatically.

## Purpose 🎯

The primary goal of this lesson is to provide a deep understanding of how strings are stored and represented in memory.
I learned how to work with ASCII and Unicode, enabling you to manipulate strings efficiently and solve real-world problems involving textual data.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, you will:

-   Understand ASCII and Unicode character sets.
-   Use the `ord()` and `chr()` functions for converting between characters and Unicode values.
-   Solve tasks that involve character manipulation, encoding, and decoding.

## Tasks 📜

### 9.7.1 Next Letter

This program identifies the next letter in the Russian alphabet or indicates when the last letter (`Я`) has been reached.

### 9.7.2 Symbols in Range

This program takes a range of Unicode values and outputs the corresponding characters.

### 9.7.3 Simple Cipher

This program converts each character in a string to its Unicode value and outputs the result.

### 9.7.4 Get Heaviest Word

This program finds the "heaviest" word by summing the Unicode values of its characters and selecting the word with the highest sum.

### 9.7.5 Get Comment Cost

This program calculates the cost of a comment in a virtual currency called "bee-coins," based on the Unicode values of its characters.

### 9.7.6 Replace English with Russian Letters

This program replaces English letters in a comment with visually similar Russian ones to increase its cost in bee-coins.

### 9.7.7 Decode Caesar Cipher

This program decodes messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher, retrieving the original text by reversing the encryption process.

### 9.7.8 Decode Russian Text

This program restores corrupted Russian text, replacing Unicode-encoded sequences with their corresponding characters, excluding `'Ё'`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson provides practical insights into string representation in computer memory, a critical concept in programming.
By mastering these techniques, I'll be equipped to handle complex string manipulation tasks in various applications.
