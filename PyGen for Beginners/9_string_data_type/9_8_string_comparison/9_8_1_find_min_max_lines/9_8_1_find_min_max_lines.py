TODO:
    The program is fed a sequence of lines, each line on a separate line.

    The end of the sequence is the word "END" (without quotes).

    However, the word "END" itself is not part of the sequence, but only
    symbolizes its end.

    Write a program that finds the maximum and minimum lines in this sequence
    (in lexicographic order) and outputs them in the following format:
        Minimum line ‚¨áÔ∏è: <minimum line>
        Maximum line ‚¨ÜÔ∏è: <maximum line>

NOTE:
    We can find maximum and minimum not only in numbers. ü§™
