# Lesson 9.8: String Comparison üî§

## Description üìù

This lesson is dedicated to the topic of string comparison, exploring the algorithms and methods used for comparing strings in Python.
In Python, strings can be compared using operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`.
Unlike numbers, string comparison is performed based on lexicographic order, which corresponds to the Unicode code points of the characters in the strings.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to understand and practice the concepts of string comparison, focusing on both single-character and multi-character string comparisons.
By completing the tasks, I learned how to handle strings effectively in various real-world scenarios.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will:

-   Compare strings of different lengths and types using Python operators.
-   Understand how lexicographic order is determined by Unicode.
-   Implement programs to solve problems based on string comparison logic.

## Tasks üìú

### 9.8.1 Find Min and Max Lines

This program identifies the lexicographically smallest and largest lines from a sequence, excluding a termination keyword.

### 9.8.2 Find Magic Number

This program calculates a "magic" number based on lexicographic comparison and Unicode properties of words.

### 9.8.3 Validate Class Name

This program validates class names for a school based on specific format requirements.

### 9.8.4 Compare Strings

This program compares two strings by ignoring case and non-alphabetic characters, checking if they are equivalent.

### 9.8.5 Sort Words Lexicographically

This program sorts three input words in lexicographic order and outputs them as a space-separated string.

### 9.8.6 Check Books Sorted

This program checks if a list of books is sorted by the author's last name, and then by title in ascending order.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson provides a comprehensive understanding of string comparison in Python, a fundamental skill for data processing, user input validation, and sorting algorithms.
Mastering these concepts will enable efficient handling of strings in various programming tasks.
