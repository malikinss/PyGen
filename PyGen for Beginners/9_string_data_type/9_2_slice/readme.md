# Lesson 9.2: String Slicing and Manipulation 📝

## Description 📝

This lesson covers slicing and manipulation techniques for strings in Python.
Learners will explore how to extract substrings, reverse strings, and perform advanced transformations.
Through practical tasks, this lesson demonstrates how to utilize Python's powerful string slicing features to manipulate and analyze text efficiently.

## Purpose 🎯

The primary goals of this lesson are to:

-   Teach learners the fundamentals of string slicing with Python's indexing and step parameters.
-   Explore practical applications of slicing, including reversing strings and extracting characters.
-   Provide hands-on experience in transforming and analyzing strings through various operations.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will:

-   Learn about slicing syntax: `string[start:end:step]`.
-   Apply slicing to perform tasks such as reversing strings, extracting specific characters, and rearranging substrings.
-   Solve tasks designed to deepen your understanding of Python string manipulation techniques.

## Tasks 📜

### 9.2.1 Code Review Task

-   Extracts the first 12 characters of a string using slicing.

### 9.2.2 Code Review Task

-   Extracts the last 9 characters of a string using slicing with negative indexing.

### 9.2.3 Code Review Task

-   Outputs every 7th character from a string using slicing with a step parameter.

### 9.2.4 Code Review Task

-   Reverses a given string using slicing with a negative step.

### 9.2.5 Is Palindrome

-   Checks if a word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version.

### 9.2.6 Process String

-   Performs various operations on a string, including repetition and reversal.

### 9.2.7 Analyze String

-   Applies slicing to extract and transform specific parts of a string.

### 9.2.8 Rearrange String

-   Splits a string into two parts and rearranges them for a transformed output.

## Conclusion 🚀

This lesson equips learners with the knowledge and skills needed to manipulate and analyze strings using slicing and indexing.
By completing the tasks, I'll develop confidence in handling text data efficiently and creatively.
