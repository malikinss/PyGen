# Palindrome Checker 🔄✨

## Description 📝

This program checks whether a given word (in lowercase) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to identify palindromes, demonstrating an efficient way to compare characters in a string.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program compares characters from the start and end of the word, moving toward the center.
-   If any mismatch is found, it outputs "NO".
-   If all characters match, it outputs "YES".

## Output 📜

The program outputs:

-   "YES" if the word is a palindrome.
-   "NO" if the word is not a palindrome.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a word in lowercase when prompted.
3. The program will determine if it is a palindrome.

Example:

```bash
Input: level
Output: YES

Input: hello
Output: NO
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides a simple and efficient way to check for palindromes, useful in text analysis and programming challenges.
