# String Analyzer 🔍

## Description 📝

This program performs various string manipulations, providing specific character extractions and transformations based on different indexing techniques.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate advanced string slicing and indexing operations in Python. It allows users to extract parts of the string and perform transformations such as reversing and indexing with even/odd characters.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The user provides a single-line string as input.
2. The program processes the string to:
    - Output the third character.
    - Output the penultimate character.
    - Output the first five characters.
    - Output the entire string except for the last two characters.
    - Output all characters with even indices.
    - Output all characters with odd indices.
    - Output all characters in reverse order.
    - Output every second character in reverse order, starting from the last one.

## Output 📜

The program produces the following outputs:

1. The third character.
2. The penultimate character.
3. The first five characters.
4. The string excluding the last two characters.
5. All characters with even indices.
6. All characters with odd indices.
7. The string in reverse order.
8. Every second character in reverse order starting from the last.

### Example:

```bash
Input: programming
Output:
o
n
progr
programm
pgamn
ormig
gnimmargorp
gmra
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program showcases advanced techniques for string slicing and manipulation, which are essential for efficiently working with text data in Python.
