# String Rearranger 🔄

## Description 📝

This program takes a string of text as input, splits it into two equal parts (or nearly equal for odd-length strings), rearranges the two parts, and displays the result.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate string manipulation and slicing in Python. It focuses on splitting a string into two parts and then rearranging the parts to provide a transformed version of the original string.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives an input string from the user.
2. It splits the string into two parts:
    - The first part will contain the first half of the string, and if the string has an odd length, it will include the extra character.
    - The second part will contain the remaining characters.
3. The program then rearranges the string by concatenating the second part with the first part.
4. The rearranged string is displayed as the output.

### Example:

```bash
Input: programming
Output: ammingpro
```

## Output 📜

The program outputs the rearranged string, which consists of the second part of the original string followed by the first part.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates how to manipulate strings by splitting and rearranging them. It is a simple but effective way to handle string operations in Python.
