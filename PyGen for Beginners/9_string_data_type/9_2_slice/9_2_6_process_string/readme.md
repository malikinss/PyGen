1. The total number of characters.
2. The original string repeated 3 times.
3. The first character.
4. The first three characters.
5. The last three characters.
6. The string in reverse order.
7. The string with the first and last characters removed.

### Example:

```bash
Input: python
Output:
6
pythonpythonpython
p
pyt
hon
nohtyp
ytho
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program demonstrates fundamental string manipulation operations, making it a versatile example for learners and developers.
