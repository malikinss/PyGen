## Description 📝

This program takes an input string from the user and prints the characters in reverse order. Each character is displayed on a new line, starting from the last character to the first.

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this program is to practice string manipulation by reversing the input string and displaying each character on a new line.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program takes an input string from the user.
2. It iterates through the string from the last character to the first.
3. Each character is printed on a new line in reverse order.

## Output 📜

The program prints each character of the input string in reverse order, each on a new line.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input a string when prompted.
3. The program will display the characters in reverse order, one per line.

### Example Usage:

1. Run the script.
2. Input: `hello`
