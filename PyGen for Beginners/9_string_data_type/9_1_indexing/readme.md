# String Operations Lesson 📚

## Description 📝

In this lesson, we will cover essential string operations in Python. We will explore how to manipulate strings through indexing, iteration, and specific operations such as counting characters, detecting digits, and more. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with strings in Python and be able to efficiently solve string-related tasks.

The topics include:

-   Basic string indexing
-   Negative indexing
-   Iterating over strings
-   String reversal
-   Extracting initials
-   Summing digits from a string
-   Checking for digits in a string
-   Counting specific symbols and adjacent identical characters
-   Analyzing vowels and consonants in Russian text
-   Converting numbers from decimal to binary

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this lesson is to help students:

1. Understand and practice basic string indexing and manipulation in Python.
2. Learn how to work with different string operations such as counting symbols, checking for digits, and calculating sums.
3. Solve practical problems involving string processing.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to apply string manipulation techniques to solve common tasks in Python.

## Tasks 💻

The lesson is divided into the following tasks:

1. **9_1_1_code_review_task**  
   Enhance a script to output a character from a string using indexing.
2. **9_1_2_code_review_task**  
   Use negative indexing to extract a specific character from a string.

3. **9_1_3_display_even_indexed_characters**  
   Display characters located at even indices in a given string.

4. **9_1_4_print_reverse_order**  
   Print the characters of a string in reverse order.

5. **9_1_5_get_initials**  
   Extract the initials from a person's full name.

6. **9_1_6_calculate_sum_of_digits**  
   Calculate the sum of all digits in a numeric string.

7. **9_1_7_check_for_digits**  
   Check whether a given string contains any numeric digits.

8. **9_1_8_count_symbols**  
   Count the occurrences of specific symbols (`+`, `*`) in a string.

9. **9_1_9_count_identical_adjacent_characters**  
   Count how many times characters are repeated consecutively in a string.

10. **9_1_10_count_vowels_and_consonants**  
    Count vowels and consonants in a string of Russian characters.

11. **9_1_11_decimal_to_binary**  
    Convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

## How It Works 🔍

Each task provides a hands-on exercise in string manipulation. The tasks guide you through using indexing, negative indexing, iteration, and string-specific methods like `.count()` and `.find()`. You will also practice string processing in the context of real-world problems, such as calculating sums or extracting initials.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Indexing**: Learn how to extract characters using both positive and negative indices.
2. **Reversal**: Reverse a string and display each character on a new line.
3. **Character Counting**: Count how many specific characters (such as digits or symbols) are in the string.

## Output 📜

Each task will output the results of string operations, such as:

-   A specific character extracted from the string.
-   A string of characters at even indices.
-   The sum of digits or the count of vowels and consonants.

## Usage 📦

Follow these steps to complete the lesson:

1. Open each task file (`9_1_1_code_review_task.py`, `9_1_2_code_review_task.py`, etc.).
2. Read the problem description and understand the goal.
3. Write your Python solution using string manipulation techniques.
4. Test your code by running the script with various inputs.
5. Review the output to ensure that the string operations work as expected.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate strings in Python. You will be able to solve real-world problems involving text data by using various string operations. This knowledge is essential for tasks like text processing, data cleaning, and building text-based applications in Python.

Good luck, and happy coding! 🎉
