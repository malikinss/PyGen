# Decimal to Binary Converter 🔢➡️💻

## Description 📝

This program converts a given natural number in the decimal system to its binary representation.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to take a decimal number as input and return its binary equivalent, which can be useful in fields like computer science, electronics, and mathematical computations.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program repeatedly divides the decimal number by 2, keeping track of the remainders.
-   The remainders form the binary digits, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost).
-   The binary digits are concatenated in reverse order to form the final binary representation.

## Output 📜

The program will output the binary representation of the given decimal number.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a natural number when prompted.
3. The program will display the binary equivalent of the number.

Example:

```bash
Input: 10
Output: 1010
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program effectively converts decimal numbers to binary, demonstrating how basic number systems work and making it useful for various applications in computing.
