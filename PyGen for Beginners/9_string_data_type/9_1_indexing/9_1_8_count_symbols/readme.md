# Symbol Counter 🔢

## Description 📝

This program counts the occurrences of the symbols `+` and `*` in a given string and displays the results.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this script is to count how many times specific symbols appear in an input string.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program accepts a string as input.
-   It counts the occurrences of the `+` and `*` symbols using Python's built-in `count()` method.
-   The program then prints the counts for both symbols.

## Output 📜

The program outputs the number of times each symbol appears in the string:

-   "Symbol + occurs X times"
-   "Symbol \* occurs Y times"

## Usage 📦

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a string when prompted.
3. View the counts of `+` and `*` symbols in the string.

## Example:

```bash
Input: a+b+c*de*f+g
Output:
Symbol + occurs 2 times
Symbol * occurs 2 times
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This script serves as a simple demonstration of counting specific characters in a string and is useful for understanding basic string operations in Python.
