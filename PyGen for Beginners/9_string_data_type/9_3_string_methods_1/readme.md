# Lesson 9.3: String Methods (Part 1) 📝

## Description 📝

This lesson introduces key Python string methods used for case conversion and formatting.
The methods covered include `capitalize()`, `swapcase()`, `title()`, `lower()`, and `upper()`.
These methods are essential for manipulating text case in various scenarios, from formatting names to performing sentiment analysis.

## Purpose 🎯

To familiarize learners with string case conversion methods and enable them to apply these tools for tasks requiring proper text formatting and analysis.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will:

-   Explore Python's string methods for converting the case of text.
-   Solve practical tasks using these methods to manipulate and analyze strings.
-   Gain hands-on experience in applying case-related string operations effectively.

## Tasks 📜

### 9.3.1 Check Name Capitalization

-   Verifies if the first and last names in a string start with capital letters, ensuring proper name formatting.

### 9.3.2 Swap Case
