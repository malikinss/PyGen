-   Provide a pathway to more advanced Python courses.

## Course Structure üìã

The course is divided into the following sections:

1. **2_input_output**
    - Learn how to print data, receive input from users, and handle basic arithmetic operations.
2. **3_io_final_tests**

    - Final test to assess your understanding of input/output operations and data handling.

3. **4_conditional_operator**

    - Master conditional operators (`if-elif-else`) to make decisions in your code.

4. **5_conditional_operator_final_tests**

    - A series of tasks to test your ability to use decision-making structures in various scenarios.

5. **6_data_types**

    - Understand the basic data types in Python (e.g., integers, floats) and how to manipulate them.

6. **7_loops**

    - Learn how to use `for` and `while` loops for iteration, and explore control mechanisms like `break`, `continue`, and `else`.

7. **8_loops_final_tests**

    - Includes theoretical questions and practical tasks related to loops to ensure mastery.

8. **9_string_data_type**

    - Dive into string operations: indexing, slicing, and string methods for text manipulation.

9. **10_string_final_tests**

    - Assess your knowledge of string manipulation with theoretical and practical tasks.

10. **11_lists**

    - Learn how to work with lists, including list operations, list comprehensions, and sorting algorithms.

11. **12_lists_final_tests**

    - Hands-on practice tasks focusing on lists, including generating and transforming data.

12. **13_functions**

    - Master functions, from basic to advanced topics like return values, parameters, and scope.

13. **14_functions_final_tests**
    - Final tests that focus on applying functions to solve practical problems.
