# Section 12: Final Tests with Lists 🧑‍💻

Welcome to Section 12 of the course!
This section focuses on final tests for working with lists in Python.
I will explore essential list operations and learn how to apply them in practical situations.
By the end of this section, I'll be equipped to handle various tasks related to lists, from creation and manipulation to validation and transformation.

## Description 📝

This section contains two lessons.
The first lesson, **12_1_part_1**, serves as an introduction without any practical tasks.
The second lesson, **12_2_part_2**, covers a variety of practical tasks aimed at refining my skills in working with lists.
These tasks include generating lists, performing element-wise operations, handling strings, validating input, and transforming data.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this section is to:

-   Teach me how to generate and manipulate lists in Python.
-   Provide hands-on experience with operations on lists, such as element-wise operations and string handling.
-   Focus on solving real-world problems using list-related techniques.
-   Introduce validation tasks, ensuring I can process and format strings correctly.

## How It Works 🔍

-   **12_1_part_1**: This part focuses on theoretical knowledge and introduces the concept of working with lists. There are no practical tasks in this part, but it's crucial for understanding the basic principles before moving to the next part.

-   **12_2_part_2**: This part includes 6 practical tasks designed to challenge and develop my skills in manipulating lists. These tasks will help me practice:
    -   **List Generation**: Creating lists using loops, list comprehensions, or predefined data.
    -   **Element-wise Operations**: Performing operations on corresponding elements of lists, such as summing elements, comparing lengths, and more.
    -   **String Handling**: Formatting and processing strings to match required patterns, including identifying the longest word.
    -   **Validation**: Implementing functions to validate input, such as checking if a phone number matches a specific format.

## Output 📜

The tasks in this section will produce different outputs depending on the specific task, such as formatted strings, validated inputs, and transformed lists.
Be sure to test my solutions with various inputs to ensure accuracy.

## Usage 📦

1. Navigate to the task directory for **12_2_part_2** to start with practical tasks.
2. Review the instructions for each task and implement the required solution.
3. Test functions with different inputs to verify their correctness.
4. For **12_1_part_1**, review the theory and concepts that are important for solving the practical tasks.

## Conclusion 🚀

After completing this section, I'll have mastered working with lists in Python, including generating, manipulating, and validating lists.
These skills are essential for more advanced programming tasks and will serve as a foundation for future learning.
