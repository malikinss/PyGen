# Lesson 12.2: Final Tests with Lists (Part 2) 🧑‍💻

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will explore various tasks related to manipulating and working with lists in Python.
These exercises focus on list generation, element-wise operations, string handling, validation, and transformations.
I will practice creating lists, performing operations on them, and formatting outputs to meet specific requirements.

## Purpose 🎯

-   **Working with Lists**: Gain experience in generating and manipulating lists using Python's built-in functions and structures.
-   **String Handling**: Learn how to process and format strings to match specific patterns.
-   **List Operations**: Practice element-wise operations like summing corresponding elements of lists and identifying the longest word in a string.
-   **Validation**: Implement validation functions to check if input matches a particular format (like phone numbers).

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will write Python programs to solve various problems.
Each task demonstrates a different aspect of working with lists, strings, and basic arithmetic operations.
I will use techniques like list comprehensions, range generation, and string formatting.
The goal is to practice both simple and intermediate tasks to strengthen my skills in handling data structures in Python.

## Tasks 📜

### 12_2_1 Even Numbers Generator

This Python program takes an even number `n` (with `n ≥ 2`) and generates a list of even numbers from 2 up to `n` (inclusive).
It then prints the list of even numbers.

### 12_2_2 Sum of Corresponding Elements in Lists

This program takes two lists of integers and creates a third list, where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.
The resulting list is then printed, with each element separated by a space.

### 12_2_3 Sum of Numbers with "+" Sign

This program takes a string of natural numbers separated by spaces, inserts a "+" sign between each number, and calculates the sum of the numbers.
The output displays the numbers in the format `number1+number2+...=sum`.

### 12_2_4 Phone Number Validation Program

This program checks if an input string is a valid phone number. The valid formats are:

-   `abc-def-hijk`
-   `7-abc-def-hijk`
    The program determines if the phone number adheres to these formats and returns a validation result.

### 12_2_5 Longest Word Length Program

This program finds the length of the longest word in a given string of text.
It uses a list comprehension to calculate the length of each word and then finds the maximum length.

### 12_2_6 Youth Jargon Converter Program

This program converts each word of an input text into "youth jargon." The conversion rule is:

-   Remove the first letter of each word and place it at the end of the word.
-   Add the syllable "ki" at the end of the word.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `12_2_lists_final_tests_part_2` directory.
3. Run each script individually:

    ```bash
    python 12_2_1_generate_even_numbers.py
    python 12_2_2_sum_lists.py
    python 12_2_3_sum_of_numbers.py
    python 12_2_4_is_valid_phone_number.py
    python 12_2_5_longest_word_length.py
    python 12_2_6_convert_to_youth_jargon.py
    ```

4. Provide the necessary input when prompted, or modify the code to pass custom parameters.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, I should be proficient in generating and manipulating lists, performing string operations, validating inputs, and applying transformations to text.
These tasks will strengthen my skills in list handling, string formatting, and basic arithmetic operations, which are essential in Python programming.
I'll keep practicing to master these techniques and improve my overall coding efficiency! 🚀✨
