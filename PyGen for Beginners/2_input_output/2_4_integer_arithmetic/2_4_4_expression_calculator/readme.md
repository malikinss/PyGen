# Expression Calculator Program

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates the value of a mathematical expression given integer values for `a` and `b`.
The expression is:
    `3(a + b)^3 + 275b^2 - 127a - 41`

The program calculates the power of numbers by repeated multiplication, avoiding the use of the exponentiation operator.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to compute a complex mathematical expression using basic arithmetic operations and repeated multiplication.
This exercise helps with understanding expression evaluation and basic programming concepts.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads integer values for `a` and `b` from the user.
2. **Calculation of \( (a + b)^3 \)**: Computes \( (a + b) \) cubed using repeated multiplication.
3. **Expression Evaluation**: Calculates the final result using the given formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = 3 \times (a + b)^3 + 275 \times b^2 - 127 \times a - 41
   \]
4. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the calculated result to the screen.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs values for `a` and `b`, the output will display the result of the expression.

For example:
    If the user inputs:
        `a = 2`
        `b = 3`

    The output will be:
        `1622`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_4_expression_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_4_expression_calculator.py`
5. Enter values for `a` and `b` when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the result of the mathematical expression.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to compute a complex mathematical expression using basic arithmetic operations and repeated multiplication.
It provides practice in handling expressions and reinforces fundamental programming skills.
Happy coding! 😊
