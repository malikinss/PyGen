# Sequence Generator

## Description 📝
This Python script generates and prints a sequence of numbers based on a positive integer input.
The sequence consists of the integer multiplied by 1 through 5, with each number separated by three dashes.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to create and format a sequence of numbers based on a given input. This exercise helps with understanding basic arithmetic operations and formatting output in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads a positive integer from the user.
2. **Sequence Generation**: Computes the sequence by multiplying the input integer by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the sequence with each number separated by three dashes (`---`).

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs a positive integer, the output will display a sequence of numbers separated by three dashes.
For example:
    If the user inputs `7`, the output will be:
        `7---14---21---28---35`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_9_sequence_generator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_9_sequence_generator.py`
5. Enter a positive integer when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the sequence of numbers separated by three dashes.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to format and output a sequence of numbers based on a user input.
It provides practice in arithmetic operations and string formatting in Python.
Happy coding! 😊
