# Next and Previous Integer Printer

## Description 📝
This Python script reads an integer from the user and prints the next and previous integers for it.
The output is formatted to clearly show the current number along with its successor and predecessor.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to compute and display the next and previous integers relative to a given number.
This exercise helps with understanding basic arithmetic operations and output formatting.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads an integer from the user.
2. **Calculation**: Computes the next integer by adding 1 and the previous integer by subtracting 1.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the next and previous integers in a formatted message.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs an integer, the output will show the next and previous integers in the following format:
    `The next integer for <current number> is: <next integer>`
    `For <current number>, the previous integer is: <previous integer>`

For example, if the user inputs `5`, the output will be:
    `The next integer for 5 is: 6` 
    `For 5 ,the previous integer is: 4`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_5_next_previous_integer_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_5_next_previous_integer_printer.py`
5. Enter an integer when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the next and previous integers in the specified format.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and formatted output in Python.
It provides practice in handling user input and displaying results in a clear and informative manner.
Happy coding! 😊
