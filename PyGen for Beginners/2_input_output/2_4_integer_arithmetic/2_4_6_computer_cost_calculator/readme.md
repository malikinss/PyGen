# Computer Cost Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates the total cost of purchasing three computers.
Each computer consists of a monitor, a system unit, a keyboard, and a mouse.
The script takes the cost of each component as input and computes the total cost for all three computers.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to calculate the total cost of multiple items based on individual component costs.
This exercise helps with understanding basic arithmetic operations and input handling.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the cost of the monitor, system unit, keyboard, and mouse from the user.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Computes the total cost of one computer by summing the costs of its components.
   - Calculates the total cost for three computers by multiplying the cost of one computer by 3.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the total cost of purchasing three computers.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the costs for the four components, the output will display the total cost of purchasing three computers.

For example:
    If the user inputs:
        `Monitor cost = 200`
        `System unit cost = 500`
        `Keyboard cost = 50`
        `Mouse cost = 20`

    The output will be:
        `2160`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_6_computer_cost_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_6_computer_cost_calculator.py`
5. Enter the cost of each component when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the total cost of purchasing three computers.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to compute the total cost of multiple items based on their individual prices.
It provides practice in arithmetic operations and input handling.
Happy coding! 😊
