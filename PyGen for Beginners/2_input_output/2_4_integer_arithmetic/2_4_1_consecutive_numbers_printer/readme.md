# Consecutive Numbers Printer Program

## Description 📝
This Python script displays three consecutive numbers, each on a separate line.
The first number is entered by the user, and the subsequent numbers are calculated and displayed by the program.
The output is formatted with each number on a new line.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to handle user input and perform simple arithmetic operations to generate a sequence of numbers.
It also shows how to format output with each number on a separate line using the `sep` parameter in the `print()` function.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the first number from the user and converts it to an integer.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Calculates the next two consecutive numbers.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the three numbers, each on a new line, using the `sep='\n'` parameter to specify the newline separator.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the first number, the output will display the three consecutive numbers, each on a separate line.
For example:
    If the user inputs `5`, the output will be:
        ```
        5
        6
        7
        ```

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_1_consecutive_numbers_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_1_consecutive_numbers_printer.py`
5. Enter the first number when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the first number and the next two consecutive numbers, each on a separate line.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise provides a straightforward example of handling user input, performing arithmetic calculations, and formatting output in Python.
It reinforces the basics of number manipulation and text output.
Happy coding! 😊
