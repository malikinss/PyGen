# Cube Volume and Surface Area Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates the volume and total surface area of a cube based on the edge length entered by the user.
The program uses basic arithmetic operations to compute the volume and surface area, without using the exponentiation operator.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to perform calculations for geometric properties of a cube using basic multiplication.
It helps reinforce understanding of volume and surface area calculations without relying on advanced operators.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the edge length of the cube from the user and converts it to an integer.
2. **Volume Calculation**: Computes the volume of the cube using the formula \( V = a \times a \times a \).
3. **Surface Area Calculation**: Computes the total surface area of the cube using the formula \( S = 6 \times (a \times a) \).
4. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the volume and surface area to the screen.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the edge length of the cube, the output will display the calculated volume and total surface area.
For example:
    If the user inputs `4`, the output will be:
        `Volume = 64`
        `Total surface area = 96`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_3_cube_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_3_cube_calculator.py`
5. Enter the edge length of the cube and press Enter.
6. The program will display the volume and total surface area of the cube.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates basic geometric calculations for a cube using multiplication.
It provides practice in performing volume and surface area computations and reinforces fundamental programming concepts.
Happy coding! 😊
