# Sum Calculator Program

## Description 📝
This Python script reads three integers from the user and prints their sum on the screen. Each integer is entered on a separate line.
The program demonstrates basic integer input, arithmetic operations, and output formatting.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to show how to read multiple integers from user input, perform an arithmetic operation (addition), and display the result.
This exercise helps with understanding integer handling and basic input/output operations in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads three integers from the user, each entered on a separate line.
2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Calculates the sum of the three integers.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the sum of the integers to the screen.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs three integers, the output will display their sum.
For example:
    If the user inputs:
        ```
        4
        5
        6
        ```

    The output will be:
        `15`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_2_sum_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_2_sum_calculator.py`
5. Enter three integers, each on a separate line, and press Enter after each.
6. The program will display the sum of the three integers.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to handle multiple integer inputs, perform basic arithmetic operations, and output the result in Python.
It reinforces fundamental concepts of input, arithmetic, and output.
Happy coding! 😊
