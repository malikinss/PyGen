# Basic Arithmetic Operations Program

## Description 📝
This Python script takes two integers as input and calculates their sum, difference, and product.
The program then outputs these results in a formatted manner, showing each arithmetic operation and its result.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and format the output to clearly show the results.
This exercise helps with understanding fundamental arithmetic operations and output formatting.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads two integers from the user.
2. **Calculations**:
   - Computes the sum of the two integers.
   - Computes the difference between the two integers.
   - Computes the product of the two integers.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the results of the calculations in a formatted message.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs two integers, the output will display the sum, difference, and product of these numbers.

For example:
    If the user inputs:
        `5`
        `3`
    The output will be:
        `5 + 3 = 8`
        `5 - 3 = 2`
        `5 * 3 = 15`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_4_7_basic_arithmetic_operations.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_4_7_basic_arithmetic_operations.py`
5. Enter two integers when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the sum, difference, and product of the two integers.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and output formatting in Python.
It provides practice in performing fundamental calculations and presenting the results in a clear and structured format.
Happy coding! 😊
