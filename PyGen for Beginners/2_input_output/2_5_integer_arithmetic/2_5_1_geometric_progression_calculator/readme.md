# Geometric Progression Term Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates the n-th term of a geometric progression.
Given the first term (`b1`), the common ratio (`q`), and the term index (`n`), the script computes the value of the n-th term using the formula:
    `b_n = b1 * q^(n - 1)`

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to compute a specific term in a geometric progression using the initial term, common ratio, and term index.
This exercise helps with understanding geometric progressions and the concept of exponents.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the first term, common ratio, and term index from the user.
2. **Calculation**: Computes the n-th term of the geometric progression using the formula:
   \[
   b_n = b1 \times q^{(n - 1)}
   \]
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the calculated n-th term.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the first term, common ratio, and term index, the output will display the n-th term of the geometric progression.
For example:
    If the user inputs:
        `2`
        `3`
        `4`

    The output will be:
        `54`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_5_1_geometric_progression_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_5_1_geometric_progression_calculator.py`
5. Enter the first term, common ratio, and term index when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the n-th term of the geometric progression.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to calculate a specific term in a geometric progression.
It provides practice in applying exponential formulas and performing arithmetic operations.
Happy coding! 😊
