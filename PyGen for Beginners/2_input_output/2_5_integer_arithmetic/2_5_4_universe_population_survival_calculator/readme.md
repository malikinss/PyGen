# Universe Population Survival Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates the number of survivors after Thanos uses the Infinity Stones to eliminate half of the Universe's population.
If the population is an odd number, the script rounds up the number of survivors to ensure that the result is a whole number.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to handle rounding in calculations where the result must be an integer.
This exercise helps with understanding integer arithmetic and handling edge cases in mathematical operations.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the population of the Universe from the user.
2. **Survivor Calculation**: Computes the number of survivors using integer division. If the population is odd, it rounds up by adding 1 before dividing by 2.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the calculated number of survivors.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the population of the Universe, the output will display the number of survivors.
For example:
    If the user inputs:
        `7`
    The output will be:
        `4`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_5_4_universe_population_survival_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_5_4_universe_population_survival_calculator.py`
5. Enter the population of the Universe when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the number of survivors.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates a practical application of integer arithmetic to handle rounding in calculations.
It provides practice in dealing with both even and odd numbers in mathematical operations.
Happy coding! 😊
