# Tangerine Distribution Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python script calculates how many tangerines each schoolchild will receive when dividing a given number of tangerines equally among schoolchildren.
It also determines how many tangerines will remain undivided in the basket.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to perform division and modulus operations to solve problems related to distributing items equally.
This exercise helps with understanding integer division and modulus operations.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Reads the number of schoolchildren and the number of tangerines from the user.
2. **Division Calculation**: Computes how many whole tangerines each schoolchild will get using integer division (`//`).
3. **Remainder Calculation**: Computes how many tangerines will remain in the basket using the modulus operator (`%`).
4. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the number of tangerines per schoolchild and the number of tangerines remaining, each on a separate line.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the number of schoolchildren and tangerines, the output will display:
1. The number of tangerines each schoolchild will receive.
2. The number of tangerines that will remain in the basket.

For example, if the user inputs:
    `5`
    `23`

The output will be:
    `4`
    `3`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_5_3_tangerine_distribution_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_5_3_tangerine_distribution_calculator.py`
5. Enter the number of schoolchildren and the number of tangerines when prompted, and press Enter.
6. The program will display the number of tangerines per schoolchild and the number of tangerines remaining.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to solve distribution problems using basic arithmetic operations.
It provides practice in integer division and modulus operations.
Happy coding! 😊
