# Lesson 2.2: Print and Input 📜

## Description 📝
This lesson covers fundamental concepts of printing to the console and handling user input in programming.
It introduces various methods for outputting data and capturing user inputs.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to use print statements and input functions to interact with the user and display information.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, you will work with different tasks that demonstrate:
- Printing simple text to the console.
- Formatting and printing sequences of data.
- Creating visual representations such as triangles using print statements.
- Handling user input and using it in different scenarios.

## Tasks 📜

### 2.2.1 Hello World
This simple Python script prints the classic "Hello, world!" message to the console.

### 2.2.2 Print Sequence
This Python script prints the sequence of numbers "4 8 15 16 23 42" with each number separated by a space.

### 2.2.3 Print Sequence Lines
This Python script prints each number in the sequence "4 8 15 16 23 42" on a separate line.

### 2.2.4 Print Triangle
This Python script prints a right-angled triangle made up of asterisks (`*`).

### 2.2.5 Greeting
This Python script reads a person's name from the standard input and displays a personalized greeting.

### 2.2.6 Football Champion
This Python script reads the name of a football team from the standard input and prints a message declaring that team as the champion.

### 2.2.7 Line Printer
This Python script reads three lines of text from standard input and prints each line in the same sequence on separate lines.

### 2.2.8 Reverse Line Printer
This Python script reads three strings from standard input and prints them in reverse order, each on a separate line.

## Conclusion 🚀
This lesson introduces essential print and input operations that are foundational to many programming tasks.
By completing these exercises, you will gain valuable skills in handling user interaction and displaying information effectively.
