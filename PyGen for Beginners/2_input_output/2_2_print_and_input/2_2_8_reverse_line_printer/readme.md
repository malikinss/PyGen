# Reverse Line Printer Program

## Description 📝
This Python script reads three strings from standard input and prints them in reverse order, each on a separate line.
The program demonstrates handling user input and outputting text in a reversed sequence.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to illustrate how to use the `input()` function to read multiple lines of text and the `print()` function to output them in reverse order.
This exercise helps with understanding basic text manipulation and output formatting in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Used three times to read three separate strings from the user.
2. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the strings in reverse order, ensuring each string is printed on a new line.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs three strings, the output will be the strings printed in reverse order. For example:
If the user inputs:
    ```
    PEACE!
    WORK!
    MAY!
    ```
The output will be:
    ```
    MAY!
    WORK!
    PEACE!
    ```

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_8_reverse_line_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_2_8_reverse_line_printer.py`
5. Enter three strings, pressing Enter after each string.
6. The program will display the strings in reverse order, each on a new line.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise provides a clear example of reversing the order of user input and printing it.
It reinforces understanding of string handling and output formatting in Python.
Happy coding! 😊
