TODO:
    Write a program that takes three strings through standard input
    (the input() command) and then prints them in reverse order,
    each on a separate line.

NOTE:
    Use the input() command to read text, and the print() command to print
    text to the screen.

    Please note that your program is running on several tests at once.
    So the solution must be universal, that is, it must print text based on
    the input data that your program receives.

    For example, if the program receives the following strings as input:
        PEACE!
        WORK!
        MAY!
    then it must print the following:
        MAY!
        WORK!
        PEACE!

a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
print(c)
print(b)
print(a)
