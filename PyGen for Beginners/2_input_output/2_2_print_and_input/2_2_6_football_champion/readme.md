# Football Team Champion Program

## Description 📝
This Python script reads the name of a football team from the standard input and prints a message declaring that team as the champion.
The program demonstrates handling user input and formatting output.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to show how to use the `input()` function to read text from the user and the `print()` function to display formatted output.
This exercise helps with understanding basic input/output operations and string formatting in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`TODO` Comment**: Describes the task of reading a football team name from input and displaying a formatted message.
2. **`input()` Function**: Used to read a string of text (the football team name) from the user.
3. **`print()` Function**: Outputs the message with the team name and the text `- champion!`.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs the name of a football team, the output will be:
    `<name of the football team> - champion!`
For example, if the user inputs Tigers, the output will be:
    `Tigers - champion!`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_6_football_champion.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
`python 2_2_6_football_champion.py`
5. Enter the name of a football team when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the message with the provided team name.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise is a simple yet effective way to practice reading input and formatting output in Python.
It reinforces the basics of user interaction and string manipulation.
Happy coding! 😊
