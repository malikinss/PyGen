TODO:
    The program is given a string of text as input - the name of
    a football team.

    Write a program that accepts this string through the standard input stream
    (the input() command) and prints a sentence in the following format:
        <name of the football team> - champion!

    where <name of the football team> is the string of text that your program
    received as input.

NOTE:
    Use the input() command to read text, and use the print() command to print
    text on the screen.

team = input()
print(team, '- champion!')
