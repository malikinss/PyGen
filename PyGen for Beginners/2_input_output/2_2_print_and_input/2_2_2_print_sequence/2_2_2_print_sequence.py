TODO:
    The popular TV series "Lost" used the sequence of numbers "4 8 15 16 23 42"
    which brought the characters luck and helped them win the jackpot in
    the lottery.

    Write a program that prints this sequence of numbers with one space
    between them.

NOTE:
    The text '4 8 15 16 23 42' cannot be used in its pure form. Instead, use
    the print() command's ability to print multiple arguments separated
    by commas.
