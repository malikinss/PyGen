# Print Number Sequence Program

## Description 📝
This Python script prints the sequence of numbers "4 8 15 16 23 42" with each number separated by a space.
The sequence is inspired by the popular TV series "Lost," where these numbers are considered to bring luck and were famously used in a lottery.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to use the `print()` function to print multiple arguments separated by spaces.
This exercise helps to understand how to manage output formatting in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`TODO` Comment**: Describes the task of printing a specific sequence of numbers and explains the context from the TV series "Lost".
2. **`NOTE` Comment**: Emphasizes that the sequence should not be hardcoded as a single string but printed using multiple arguments in the `print()` function.
3. **`print()` Function**: Utilized to print each number separately, with Python automatically inserting spaces between the arguments.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed, the output will be:
    `4 8 15 16 23 42`

## Usage 📦
To run this program:
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_2_print_sequence.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    ` python 2_2_2_print_sequence.py`

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates the flexibility of the `print()` function in Python for formatting output.
It is a practical example of how to handle multiple pieces of data to produce a desired format.

Happy coding! 😊
