# Print Number Sequence on Separate Lines Program

## Description 📝
This Python script prints each number in the sequence "4 8 15 16 23 42" on a separate line.
The program is a modification of the previous script, demonstrating how to print each element of a sequence on its own line.

## Purpose 🎯
The objective of this program is to show how to use the `print()` function to output each item on a new line.
This exercise is useful for understanding how line breaks can be managed in output formatting.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`TODO` Comment**: Describes the task of modifying the previous program to print each number on a separate line.
2. **`NOTE` Comment**: Explains that each `print()` command outputs the specified text starting on a new line.
3. **`print()` Function**: Called multiple times, with each call printing a single number followed by a newline.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed, the output will be:
    ```python
    4
    8
    15
    16
    23
    42```

## Usage 📦
To run this program:
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_3_print_sequence_lines.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    `python 2_2_3_print_sequence_lines.py`

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise illustrates how to print multiple lines of output by using separate print() statements.
It highlights how to manage line breaks and output formatting in Python.
Happy coding! 😊
