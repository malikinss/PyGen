# Greeting Program

## Description 📝
This Python script reads a person's name from the standard input and displays a personalized greeting.
The program demonstrates how to handle user input and produce formatted output.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to showcase how to use the `input()` function to accept user input and the `print()` function to display output.
This exercise is useful for understanding basic input/output operations in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`TODO` Comment**: Describes the task of reading a name from the input and displaying a greeting.
2. **`input()` Function**: Used to read a string of text from the user.
3. **`print()` Function**: Displays a greeting message with the user's name.

## Usage 📦
To run this program:
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_5_greeting.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    `python 2_2_5_greeting.py`
5. Enter a name when prompted and press Enter.
6. The program will display the greeting with the provided name.

## Conclusion 🚀
