TODO:
    The program is given a string of text as input - a person's name.

    Write a program that accepts this string of text via the standard input
    stream (the input() command).

    The program should then display a greeting on the screen in the
    following format:
        Hello, <person's name>
    where <person's name> is the string of text that your program received
    as input.

NOTE:
    To read text, use the input() command; to print text on the screen,
    use the print() command.
'''
name = input()
print('Hello,', name)
