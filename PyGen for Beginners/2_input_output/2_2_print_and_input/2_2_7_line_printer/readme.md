# Line Printer Program

## Description 📝
This Python script reads three lines of text from standard input and prints each line in the same sequence on separate lines.
The program demonstrates basic text input and output operations.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to illustrate how to use the `input()` function to receive user input and the `print()` function to output text.
This exercise helps with understanding fundamental input/output operations in Python.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`input()` Function**: Used three times to read three separate lines of text from the user.
2. **`print()` Function**: Outputs each line of text on a new line in the same order it was input.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed and the user inputs three lines of text, the output will be each line printed separately. For example:
If the user inputs:
    ```
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    ```
The output will be:
    ```
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    ```

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_7_line_printer.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
   `python 2_2_7_line_printer.py`
5. Enter three lines of text, pressing Enter after each line.
6. The program will display each line of text on a separate line.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise provides a simple demonstration of reading multiple lines of input and printing them in sequence.
It reinforces the basics of user interaction and output formatting in Python.
Happy coding! 😊
