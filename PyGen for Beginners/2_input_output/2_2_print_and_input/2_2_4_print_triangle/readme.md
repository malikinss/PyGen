# Print Asterisk Triangle Program

## Description 📝
This Python script prints a right-angled triangle made up of asterisks (`*`).
Each line of the triangle contains one more asterisk than the previous line, starting from one asterisk on the first line and ending with seven asterisks on the last line.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to use the `print()` function to create simple patterns.
It also introduces beginners to basic repetition and pattern-building concepts in programming.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **`TODO` Comment**: Describes the task of printing a triangle pattern made of asterisks.
2. **`print()` Function**: Called multiple times, each time printing a string with an increasing number of asterisks (`*`), forming a triangle shape when viewed in the console.

## Output 📜
When the script is executed, the output will be:
    ```python
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******
    *******
    ```

## Usage 📦
To run this program:
1. Save the code to a file named `2_2_4_print_triangle`.py.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Execute the script using the command:
    ` python 2_2_4_print_triangle.py`

You will see a triangle of asterisks printed line by line in the terminal.

## Conclusion 🚀
This exercise demonstrates how to create basic patterns with loops or repeated print() statements.
It helps to strengthen your understanding of string manipulation and printing techniques in Python.
Happy coding! 😊
