# Weekend Detection Program

## Description 📝
This Python program checks if the input string contains the words "Saturday" or "Sunday" and prints "YES" if found, or "NO" otherwise.

## Purpose 🎯
The program aims to demonstrate how to search for multiple substrings within a string, focusing on detecting weekend days.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program reads a line of text from the user.
2. **Substring Check**:
   - It checks if either "Saturday" or "Sunday" is present in the input string using the `in` operator combined with the `or` logical operator.
3. **Output**:
   - If either substring is found, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

## Output 📜
The program will output: `YES`
if the input contains "Saturday" or "Sunday", or: `NO` if neither is present.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_2_7_weekend_detection.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_2_7_weekend_detection.py`
5. Enter a line of text when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program is a simple demonstration of searching for multiple substrings in Python.
It’s useful for detecting whether a given input contains weekend days like "Saturday" or "Sunday".
