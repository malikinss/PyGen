# Lesson 6.2: String Data Type ‚ú®

## Description üìù
This lesson focuses on working with string data type.
The tasks in this section involve manipulating, analyzing, and validating strings, which are one of the most fundamental data types in programming.

## Purpose üéØ
The purpose of this lesson is to practice string operations such as concatenation, searching, validation, and measuring string length.
These tasks will help me become more proficient in working with text data.

## How It Works üîç
In this chapter, I will:
- Concatenate and manipulate strings.
- Search for substrings within larger texts.
- Validate string input for specific formats such as email addresses.

## Tasks üìú
### 6.2.1 Text Concatenation
This Python program prints a specific text that demonstrates string concatenation.

### 6.2.2 Greeting
This Python program reads the user's first and last name from the keyboard and outputs a personalized greeting.

### 6.2.3 Football Team
This Python program reads the name of a football team from the keyboard and outputs the length of the name.

### 6.2.4 City Name Length
This Python program reads the names of three cities and determines which city has the shortest name and which has the longest name.

### 6.2.5 String Length AP
This Python program reads three lines of input and checks whether their lengths can form an increasing arithmetic progression.

### 6.2.6 Substring Search
This Python program checks if the word "blue" is present in a user-provided string and prints "YES" if found or "NO" otherwise.

### 6.2.7 Weekend Detection
This Python program checks if the input string contains the words "Saturday" or "Sunday" and prints "YES" if found, or "NO" otherwise.

### 6.2.8 Email Validation
This Python program checks if a given email address is valid by verifying if it contains both the "@" symbol and at least one dot (".").

## Conclusion üöÄ
This lesson strengthens my skills in handling strings, from basic operations like concatenation to more complex tasks like validation.
Understanding strings is essential in almost every programming domain, and mastering these tasks will greatly improve my proficiency.
