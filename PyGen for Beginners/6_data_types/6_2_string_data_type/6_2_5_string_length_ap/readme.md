# Arithmetic Progression from String Lengths

## Description 📝
This Python program reads three lines of input and checks whether their lengths can form an increasing arithmetic progression.

## Purpose 🎯
The goal of this program is to determine whether the lengths of three entered strings can form an arithmetic progression, where the difference between consecutive elements is the same.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter three strings.
2. **Length Calculation**:
   - It calculates the lengths of the three strings using the `len()` function.
3. **Progression Check**:
   - The program checks whether the differences between the longest, middle, and shortest string lengths form an arithmetic progression.
4. **Output**:
   - If the strings can form an arithmetic progression based on their lengths, the program prints `YES`. Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

## Output 📜
The program will output either: `YES`
if an arithmetic progression is possible, or: `NO` if not.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_2_5_string_length_ap.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_2_5_string_length_ap.py`
5. Enter three lines of text when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program checks if the lengths of three input strings can form an arithmetic progression, offering a simple but insightful exercise in string manipulation and number sequences. 📏➕➖
