# Email Validation Program

## Description 📝
This Python program checks if a given email address is valid by verifying if it contains both the "@" symbol and at least one dot (".").

   - If either character is missing, it prints "NO".

## Output 📜
The program will output: `YES` if the input contains both the "@" symbol and dots, or: `NO` if one or both characters are missing.

## Usage 📦
