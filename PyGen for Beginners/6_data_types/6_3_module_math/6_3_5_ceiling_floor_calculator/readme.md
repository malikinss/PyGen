# Ceiling and Floor Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the sum of the ceiling and floor values of a given real number \( x \).

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates the use of mathematical functions to obtain the ceiling and floor of a number, which are fundamental concepts in various mathematical applications.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a real number \( x \).
2. **Calculations**:
   - The ceiling of \( x \) (denoted as \( \lceil x \rceil \)) is calculated using the `ceil()` function.
   - The floor of \( x \) (denoted as \( \lfloor x \rfloor \)) is calculated using the `floor()` function.
   - The program computes the sum of these two values.
3. **Output**:
   - The result of the sum is printed.

## Output 📜
The program outputs the value of \( \lceil x \rceil + \lfloor x \rfloor \).

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_5_ceiling_floor_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_5_ceiling_floor_calculator.py`
5. Enter the real number when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward way to calculate the ceiling and floor values of a number, useful for mathematical analysis and programming tasks. 📊
