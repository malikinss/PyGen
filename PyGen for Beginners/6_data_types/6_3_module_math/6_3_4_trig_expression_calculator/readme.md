# Trigonometric Expression Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the value of the trigonometric expression \( \sin(x) + \cos(x) + \tan^2(x) \) for a given angle \( x \) in degrees.

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates the use of trigonometric functions and the conversion of degrees to radians, essential concepts in mathematics and engineering.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input an angle in degrees.
2. **Conversion to Radians**:
   - The input angle is converted from degrees to radians using:
     \[
     r = \frac{x \cdot \pi}{180}
     \]
   - Alternatively, the program utilizes the built-in `radians()` function from the math module.
3. **Calculations**:
   - The program computes the expression:
     \[
     f = \sin(x) + \cos(x) + \tan^2(x)
     \]
4. **Output**:
   - The result of the expression is printed.

## Output 📜
The program will output the value of the expression based on the user-provided angle.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_4_trig_expression_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_4_trig_expression_calculator.py`
5. Enter the angle in degrees when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively calculates a specific trigonometric expression, providing a useful tool for understanding trigonometric relationships in different contexts. 🌐
