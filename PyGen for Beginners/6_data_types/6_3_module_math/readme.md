# Lesson 6.3: Module Math ‚ûó

## Description üìù
This lesson focuses on the use of the mathematical module in programming.
It includes tasks that involve calculations of distances, areas, means, and other mathematical expressions using Python's `math` module.

## Purpose üéØ
The purpose of this lesson is to deepen my understanding of mathematical calculations and the application of mathematical functions in programming. 
These tasks will help me become proficient in solving real-world problems using mathematics.

## How It Works üîç
In this lesson, I will:
- Implement calculations for various mathematical operations.
- Utilize the `math` module to solve problems related to geometry, algebra, and trigonometry.

## Tasks üìú
### 6.3.1 Euclidean Distance
This Python program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a two-dimensional space.

### 6.3.2 Circle Calculator
This Python program calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on a given radius `R`.

### 6.3.3 Means Calculator
This Python program calculates and displays four types of means for two given numbers `a` and `b`: arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, and quadratic mean.

### 6.3.4 Trig Expression Calculator
This Python program calculates the value of the trigonometric expression `sin(x) + cos(x) + tan^2(x)` for a given angle `x` in degrees.

### 6.3.5 Ceiling and Floor Calculator
This Python program calculates the sum of the ceiling and floor values of a given real number `x`.

### 6.3.6 Quadratic Solver
This Python program finds the real roots of a quadratic equation of the form:
`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers provided by the user.

### 6.3.7 Polygon Area Calculator
This Python program calculates the area of a regular polygon given its side length `a` and the number of sides `n`.

## Conclusion üöÄ
This lesson equips me with essential skills for performing mathematical calculations using Python.
Mastery of these concepts is crucial for tackling more complex problems in programming and data analysis.
