# Means Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates and displays four types of means for two given numbers \( a \) and \( b \): arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, and quadratic mean.

## Purpose 🎯
The program illustrates the computation of different mathematical means, enhancing understanding of their definitions and applications in statistics.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input two numbers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Calculations**:
   - **Arithmetic Mean**:
     \[
     \text{Arithmetic Mean} = \frac{(a + b)}{2}
     \]
   - **Geometric Mean**:
     \[
     \text{Geometric Mean} = \sqrt{(a \cdot b)}
     \]
   - **Harmonic Mean**:
     \[
     \text{Harmonic Mean} = \frac{2 \cdot a \cdot b}{(a + b)}
     \]
   - **Quadratic Mean**:
     \[
     \text{Quadratic Mean} = \sqrt{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)}{2}}
     \]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints each of the calculated means on a new line.

## Output 📜
The program will output the four calculated means in the following order:
1. Arithmetic Mean
2. Geometric Mean
3. Harmonic Mean
4. Quadratic Mean

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_3_means_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_3_means_calculator.py`
5. Enter the two numbers when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively demonstrates how to compute various mathematical means, providing a valuable tool for statistical analysis.
