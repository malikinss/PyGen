# Regular Polygon Area Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the area of a regular polygon given its side length \( a \) and the number of sides \( n \).

## Purpose 🎯
The program helps users understand how to calculate the area of regular polygons and provides a practical application of geometry concepts.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter a natural number \( n \) (the number of sides) and a real number \( a \) (the side length).
2. **Area Calculation**:
   - It calculates the area \( S \) using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n \cdot a^2}{4 \cdot \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)}
   \]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated area of the regular polygon.

## Output 📜
The program displays the area of the regular polygon based on the provided values of \( n \) and \( a \).

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_7_polygon_area_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_7_polygon_area_calculator.py`
5. Enter the values of \( n \) and \( a \) when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward method for calculating the area of regular polygons, illustrating the application of trigonometric functions in geometry. 📐
