# Circle Area and Circumference Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on a given radius \( R \).

## Purpose 🎯
The program demonstrates the application of mathematical formulas to compute the area and circumference of a circle, reinforcing understanding of geometric principles.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the radius \( R \) of the circle.
2. **Calculations**:
   - The area is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi R^2
     \]
   - The circumference is calculated using the formula:
     \[Circumference = 2\pi R\]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the area and circumference, each on a new line.

## Output 📜
The program will output the calculated area and circumference of the circle.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_2_circle_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_2_circle_calculator.py`
5. Enter the radius when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively demonstrates how to compute the area and circumference of a circle, utilizing the math library for accurate calculations.
