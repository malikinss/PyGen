# Euclidean Distance Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a two-dimensional space.
The distance is computed using the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

## Purpose 🎯
The program serves to illustrate how to calculate the distance between two points using their coordinates, applying fundamental mathematical concepts.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the coordinates of two points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It computes the squared differences of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - Then, it sums these squared differences and takes the square root to find the distance.
3. **Output**:
   - The calculated Euclidean distance is printed.

## Output 📜
The program will output the Euclidean distance between the two specified points.

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_3_1_euclidean_distance.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_3_1_euclidean_distance.py`
5. Enter the coordinates when prompted in the format:
    `x1` `y1` `x2` `y2`

## Conclusion 🚀
This program effectively demonstrates how to compute the Euclidean distance between two points using basic arithmetic and functions from the math library.
