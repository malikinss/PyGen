# Sum of Moduli Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the sum of the absolute values (moduli) of five given numbers.
The formula used is: 
\[
|a1| + |a2| + |a3| + |a4| + |a5|
\]

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to provide a simple way to compute the sum of absolute values for a set of numbers, which can be useful in various mathematical and statistical analyses.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input five numbers.
2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates the absolute value of each number.
   - It sums these absolute values.
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total sum of the absolute values.

## Output 📜
The output will be a single float value representing the sum of the moduli of the input numbers.

### Example:
For input: `-3` `4` `-1` `2` `5`
The output will be: `15.0`
