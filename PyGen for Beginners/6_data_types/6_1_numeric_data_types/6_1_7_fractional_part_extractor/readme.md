# Fractional Part Extractor

## Description 📝
This Python program reads a positive real number from the user and prints its fractional part.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to provide a simple tool for extracting and displaying the fractional part of a given positive real number.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input a positive real number.
2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates the fractional part by using the modulus operation (`num % 1`), which returns the remainder of the number when divided by 1.
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the fractional part of the input number.

## Output 📜
The output will be the fractional part of the input number.

### Example:
For input: `3.14159`
The output will be: `0.14159`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_1_7_fractional_part_extractor.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_1_7_fractional_part_extractor.py`
5. Enter a positive real number when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program serves as a straightforward solution for retrieving the fractional part of a positive real number, useful for various mathematical applications.
