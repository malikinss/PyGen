# Reciprocal Number Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the reciprocal of a given number.
If the number is zero, it handles the case appropriately by displaying a specific message.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine the reciprocal of a user-inputted number, providing a clear message if the input is zero since the reciprocal does not exist in that case.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input a number.
2. **Calculation**:
   - If the input number is zero, it prints "Reciprocal number does not exist".
   - For any other number, it calculates the reciprocal using the formula:
   \[
   \text{reciprocal} = \frac{1}{\text{number}}
   \]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the reciprocal of the number.

## Output 📜
The output will either be the reciprocal of the number or a message indicating that the reciprocal does not exist.

### Example:
For input: `5`
The output will be: `0.2`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_1_3_reciprocal_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_1_3_reciprocal_calculator.py`
5. Enter a number when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward solution for calculating the reciprocal of a number while gracefully handling the special case of zero.
