# Meeting Time Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the time it takes for two individuals to meet while walking towards each other at constant speeds.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine how long it will take for two old women to meet based on their speeds and the distance separating them.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the distance \( S \) (in kilometers) between the two women and their respective speeds \( v1 \) and \( v2 \) (in kilometers per hour).
2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates the time until they meet using the formula:
   \[
   t = \frac{S}{v1 + v2}
   \]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time \( t \) in hours.

## Output 📜
The output will be a single float value representing the time (in hours) it will take for the two women to meet.

### Example:
For input: `10` `2` `3`
The output will be: `2.0`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_1_2_meeting_time_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_1_2_meeting_time_calculator.py`
5. Enter the distance and speeds when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a simple way to calculate the meeting time for two individuals based on their speeds and distance apart, useful in various real-world scenarios.
