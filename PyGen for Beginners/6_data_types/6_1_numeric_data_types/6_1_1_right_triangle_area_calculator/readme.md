# Right Triangle Area Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the area of a right triangle given the lengths of its two legs.
The area is computed using the formula \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2 \).

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to provide a quick and easy way to compute the area of a right triangle based on user-provided leg lengths.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the lengths of the two legs of the triangle.
2. **Area Calculation**:
   - It calculates the area using the formula mentioned above.
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated area.

## Output 📜
The output is the area of the triangle, represented as a floating-point number.

### Example:
For input: `3` `4`
The output will be: `6.0`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_1_1_right_triangle_area_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_1_1_right_triangle_area_calculator.py`
5. Enter the lengths of the two legs when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program efficiently calculates the area of a right triangle, helping users understand the relationship between the triangle's leg lengths and its area.
