# Manhattan Distance Calculator

## Description 📝
This Python program calculates the Manhattan distance between two points on a plane.
The Manhattan distance is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to compute the distance between two points in a grid-like path, as one would experience in urban environments like Manhattan, where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical paths.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the coordinates of two points: (p1, p2) and (q1, q2).
2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates the Manhattan distance using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = |p1 - q1| + |p2 - q2|
   \]
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated Manhattan distance as an integer.

## Output 📜
The output will be a single integer value representing the Manhattan distance between the two points.

### Example:
For input: `1` `2` `4` `6`
The output will be: `7`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `6_1_12_manhattan_distance_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 6_1_12_manhattan_distance_calculator.py`
5. Enter the coordinates of the two points when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program provides a straightforward method to calculate the Manhattan distance, making it useful for applications in geometry, navigation, and urban planning.
