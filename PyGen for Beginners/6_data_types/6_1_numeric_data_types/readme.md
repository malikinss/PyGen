In this lesson, you will:
- Implement programs that perform various numeric calculations and conversions.
- Practice using different numeric types effectively to solve problems.

## Tasks üìú
### 6.1.1 Right Triangle Area Calculator
This Python program calculates the area of a right triangle given the lengths of its two legs.

### 6.1.2 Meeting Time Calculator
This Python program calculates the time it takes for two individuals to meet while walking towards each other at constant speeds.

### 6.1.3 Reciprocal Calculator
This Python program calculates the reciprocal of a given number.

### 6.1.4 Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
This Python program converts a temperature from the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius scale using the formula:
\[
C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32)
\]

### 6.1.5 Dog Years to Human Years Converter
This Python program converts a dog's age in dog years to human years.

### 6.1.6 First Digit After Decimal
