## Description 📝
This Python program checks if a three-digit number is "interesting".
A number is defined as interesting if the difference between the maximum and minimum digits is equal to the average digit.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to determine the interestingness of a three-digit number based on its digits.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input a three-digit number.
2. **Digit Extraction**:
   - It extracts the individual digits of the number:
     - The first digit (hundreds)
     - The second digit (tens)
     - The third digit (units)
3. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates:
     - The maximum and minimum digits.
     - The average digit.
     - The difference between the maximum and minimum digits.
4. **Condition Check**:
