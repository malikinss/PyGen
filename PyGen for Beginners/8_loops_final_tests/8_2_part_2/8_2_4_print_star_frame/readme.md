# Star Frame

## Description 📝

This program prints a star frame of size `n*19`, where `n` is the number of rows input by the user. The frame consists of stars `*`, with the first and last rows completely filled with stars, and the intermediate rows having stars at the beginning and end, with spaces in between.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to print a rectangular star frame of size `n*19`, where the number of rows is specified by the user. It is useful for learning basic programming concepts like loops and string formatting.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The program receives a natural number `n` as input, which specifies the number of rows for the star frame.
2. It then iterates through the range of rows:
    - For the first and last row, it prints a full line of 19 stars.
    - For the intermediate rows, it prints a star, followed by 17 spaces, and then another star.
3. The program prints the frame on the screen.

## Output 📜

The program prints the star frame based on the input value `n`.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input a natural number `n` (the number of rows for the frame).
3. The program will print the star frame with `n` rows and 19 columns.

### Example Usage:

1. Run the script.
2. Input: `5`
3. Output:

```bash
*******************
*                 *
*                 *
*                 *
*******************
```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program generates a simple star frame of a given size, helping to practice string manipulation and loops in Python.
