# Final Test on Loops: Practical Tasks 🚀

## Description 📝

This final test evaluates the ability to work with loops and control structures to solve practical programming problems.
The tasks involve processing numbers, handling sequences, and creating patterns with loops.
The test also emphasizes identifying and correcting logical and syntactical errors in code.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this test is to:

-   Strengthen understanding of loops and iterations.
-   Apply loops to solve real-world problems, such as counting, summing digits, and generating patterns.
-   Review and debug code to improve logical flow and correctness.

## How It Works 🔍

The test includes several tasks where you will be required to implement solutions using loops.
The problems range from analyzing numbers and their properties to generating textual patterns like star frames.
Some tasks also involve fixing bugs and improving existing code.

## Tasks 📜

### 8.2.1 Code Review Task

This program processes a natural number and calculates the sum of its even digits.
If the number contains no even digits, the program outputs `0`.

### 8.2.2 Code Review Task

This program processes a sequence of 8 integers and calculates:

1. The number of integers divisible by 4.
2. The maximum integer divisible by 4.

If no number is divisible by 4, the program outputs `"NO"`.

### 8.2.3 Code Review Task

This program takes a sequence of 4 integers and determines:

1. The number of odd numbers in the sequence.
2. The maximum odd number in the sequence.

If there are no odd numbers, the program outputs `"NO"`.

### 8.2.4 Print Star Frame

This program prints a rectangular star frame of size `n*19`, where `n` is the number of rows.
The frame consists of stars `*`, with the first and last rows completely filled with stars, and the intermediate rows having stars at the beginning and end, with spaces in between.

### 8.2.5 Third Digit

This program determines the third digit from the beginning of a given natural number `n` (where `n` is greater than 99).
The program extracts and returns the third digit by reducing the number to a value with three or fewer digits and then extracting the rightmost digit.

### 8.2.6 Analyze Number

This program analyzes a given natural number and calculates various properties about its digits:

1. The number of occurrences of the digit `3`.
2. The frequency of the last digit in the number.
3. The count of even digits.
4. The sum of digits greater than five.
5. The result of multiplying digits greater than seven (or 1 if none are found).
6. The total count of occurrences of the digits `0` and `5`.

## Conclusion 🚀

This final test serves as a comprehensive exercise to apply and reinforce the concepts of loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic operations.
By completing the tasks, you will strengthen your ability to solve programming problems efficiently using loops.
