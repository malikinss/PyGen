# Lesson 14.1: Function Tasks üßë‚Äçüíª

## Description üìù

This lesson focuses on solving various real-world problems using Python functions.
Each task demonstrates the use of functions to perform different types of calculations, checks, and operations.
The tasks include drawing shapes, calculating binomial coefficients, converting numbers to words, and more.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this lesson is to:

-   Enhance problem-solving skills using Python functions.
-   Teach how to implement practical algorithms, such as generating shapes, computing binomial coefficients, and checking for pangrams or magic dates.
-   Introduce common utility functions that can be used in different applications, including language localization and fun date-related checks.

## How It Works üîç

The lesson is structured around seven tasks, each focusing on a specific type of function.
I will learn to implement these functions step by step, understanding their purpose, inputs, and outputs.

## Tasks üìú

### 14_1_1 Draw Triangle

Draw an isosceles triangle made of stars (`*`) with a base of 15 stars and a height of 8 rows.
The triangle is symmetrical and centered horizontally.

### 14_1_2 Get Shipping Cost

Calculate the total shipping cost for an order based on the number of products.
The base rate for express delivery is 1000 rubles, with an additional 120 rubles for each subsequent product.

### 14_1_3 Compute Binomial Coefficient

Calculate the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements using the formula:  
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

### 14_1_4 Number to Words (Russian) Converter

Convert a natural number between 1 and 99 into its verbal description in Russian.
For example, `42` becomes "—Å–æ—Ä–æ–∫ –¥–≤–∞."

### 14_1_5 Get Month Name

Return the name of a month in either Russian (`ru`) or English (`eng`) based on the month number (1 to 12) provided by the user.

### 14_1_6 Magic Date Checker

Check if a given date is "magic."
A date is magic if the day multiplied by the month equals the last two digits of the year.

### 14_1_7 Pangram Checker

Check if a given text is a **pangram**.
A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once.

## Usage üì¶

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/function-tasks.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `14_1_function_tasks` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 14_1_1_draw_triangle.py
    python 14_1_2_get_shipping_cost.py
    python 14_1_3_compute_binom.py
    python 14_1_4_number_to_words_ru.py
    python 14_1_5_get_month.py
    python 14_1_6_is_magic.py
    python 14_1_7_is_pangram.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts and observe the results in the terminal.

## Conclusion üöÄ

This lesson provides a hands-on experience with solving practical problems using Python functions.
Mastering these tasks will enhance my ability to implement functions for real-world applications, from calculating shipping costs to checking for magic dates and pangrams.
Keep practicing these challenges to improve Python skills! üöÄ‚ú®
