# Binomial Coefficient Calculator 🧮

## Description 📝

This Python script calculates the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements. The formula used is:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
Where \( n! \) is the factorial of \( n \).

## Purpose 🎯

The `compute_binom` function simplifies the calculation of binomial coefficients, which are widely used in combinatorics, probability, and statistics. This script is useful for solving problems involving combinations and permutations.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `compute_binom(n, k)`**:

    - Uses the formula for the binomial coefficient.
    - The `math.factorial` function calculates the factorial of \( n \), \( k \), and \( n - k \).
    - The result is computed using integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is always an integer.

2. **Example**:

    ```
    Enter the value of n: 5
    Enter the value of k: 3
    Output: 10
    ```

    - \( C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = 10 \)

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - \( C(n, 0) = 1 \)
    - \( C(n, n) = 1 \)
    - If \( k > n \), the function will raise a `ValueError` if necessary.

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., `binomial_calculator.py`.
2. Run the script in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python binomial_calculator.py
    ```
3. Enter the desired values for \( n \) and \( k \) when prompted.
4. The binomial coefficient will be displayed.

## Conclusion 🚀

This script provides a quick and efficient way to compute binomial coefficients, making it a valuable tool for mathematical and statistical computations.
It leverages Python’s built-in `math` module to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
