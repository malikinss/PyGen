# Lesson 13.2: User-defined Functions with Parameters 🧑‍💻

## Description 📝

In this lesson, I will explore creating user-defined functions that take parameters.
I will learn how to define functions that accept input values and how those values can be used within the function.
The lesson also covers the concept of variable scope in relation to parameters.
I will solve three problems that demonstrate the use of parameters in functions, such as drawing shapes, printing initials, and calculating the sum of digits.

## Purpose 🎯

-   **Functions with Parameters**: Learn how to define and use functions that take input parameters.
-   **Variable Scope**: Understand how parameters are scoped within a function and how they can affect the function's behavior.
-   **Practical Examples**: Solve practical problems using functions with parameters to manipulate strings, numbers, and draw shapes.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I will define functions that accept parameters, allowing for flexible and dynamic behavior based on user input.
The lesson includes three tasks that require passing parameters into functions, which will be processed to generate desired outputs.

## Tasks 📜

### 13_2_1 Draw Triangle

This Python program draws an isosceles triangle using a specified fill character (`fill`) and an odd number for the base length (`base`).
The triangle is centered, and the fill character creates the triangle's structure.

### 13_2_2 Print Full Name Initials

This Python program takes a person's full name, which includes their first name (`name`), surname (`surname`), and patronymic (`patronymic`), and prints out the initials of the full name in uppercase letters.

### 13_2_3 Calculate Sum of Digits

This Python program calculates and prints the sum of the digits of a given integer.
The program iterates through each digit of the number, adds it to a running total, and then outputs the sum.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `13_2_functions_with_params` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 13_2_1_draw_triangle.py
    python 13_2_2_print_fio.py
    python 13_2_3_print_digit_sum.py
    ```
4. Provide the necessary input when prompted, or modify the code to pass custom parameters.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, I should be able to define and use user-defined functions with parameters.
This will enable me to write more flexible and reusable code.
Understanding how parameters work and how variable scope operates will be essential as I advance in my programming journey.
Keep practicing by creating functions that accept various types of parameters to solve more complex problems. 🚀✨
