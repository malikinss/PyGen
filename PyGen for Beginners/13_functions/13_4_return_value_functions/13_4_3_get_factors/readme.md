# Factor Finder Program 🔍

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a natural number as input and returns a list of all factors of that number.
A factor of a number is any integer that divides the number exactly without leaving a remainder.

## Purpose 🎯

-   To find all factors of a given natural number.
-   Useful for mathematical problems, number theory, and divisibility checks.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `get_factors(num)`**:
    - Takes one input parameter: `num` (a natural number).
    - It iterates through all integers from 1 to `num` and checks which integers divide `num` exactly (i.e., without a remainder).
    - Returns a list of integers that are factors of the given number.
2. **Example**:
   For the input `num = 12`, the output will be:
    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
    ```

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., `factor_finder.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the script by executing:
    ```bash
    python factor_finder.py
    ```
5. Input a natural number, and the program will print a list of all its factors.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program calculates and displays all factors of a given natural number, making it a useful tool for number-related tasks and divisibility checks.
