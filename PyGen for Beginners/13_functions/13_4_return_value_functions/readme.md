# Lesson 13.4: Functions with Return Values üîô

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I will explore the concept of functions that return values.
Unlike functions that merely perform actions, return value functions produce a result that can be used in further computations or processing.
Functions with return values are essential in solving real-world problems and creating reusable code that can be integrated into larger programs.
I will cover several tasks where functions return meaningful values such as distances, days, factors, and merged lists.

## Purpose üéØ

-   **Return Value Functions**: Learn how to define functions that return values for further processing.
-   **Practical Examples**: Apply the concept of return values to solve real-world problems like unit conversion, counting factors, and merging lists.
-   **Mathematical and Programming Techniques**: Use functions to simplify mathematical calculations and list operations.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, functions will return values that can be used in subsequent code, making my programs more modular and flexible.
Each function in the tasks below will perform a specific calculation or task and then return the result to the caller.

## Tasks üìú

### 13_4_1 Convert Kilometers to Miles

This Python program converts a distance from kilometers to miles using the given conversion formula.
It accepts an input distance in kilometers and returns the equivalent distance in miles.  
**Purpose**: To convert a distance from kilometers to miles.

### 13_4_2 Get Number of Days in a Month

This Python program takes the number of a month (from 1 to 12) and returns the number of days in that month, assuming the year is a non-leap year.  
**Purpose**: To determine how many days are in a given month.

### 13_4_3 Find All Factors of a Number

This Python program calculates and returns a list of all factors of a given number.
A factor is an integer that divides the number exactly.  
**Purpose**: To find all factors of a given natural number.

### 13_4_4 Count the Number of Factors

This Python program calculates the number of factors of a given natural number by using the `get_factors` function and returns the count.  
**Purpose**: To determine how many factors a number has.

### 13_4_5 Find All Symbol Locations

This Python program returns a list containing all the indices of a specified character in a string.
It helps locate the positions of a symbol within a string.  
**Purpose**: To find all occurrences of a character within a string.

### 13_4_6 Merge Two Sorted Lists

This Python program merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.
It compares the elements and adds them in sorted order.  
**Purpose**: To merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.

### 13_4_7 Quick Merge Multiple Lists

This Python program merges multiple sorted lists into one sorted list using the `quick_merge()` function.
It reads `n` sorted integer lists and merges them into one final sorted list.  
**Purpose**: To merge multiple sorted integer lists into one sorted list.

## Usage üì¶

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `13_4_return_value_functions` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 13_4_1_convert_to_miles.py
    python 13_4_2_get_days.py
    python 13_4_3_get_factors.py
    python 13_4_4_number_of_factors.py
    python 13_4_5_find_all.py
    python 13_4_6_merge.py
    python 13_4_7_quick_merge.py
    ```
4. Provide the necessary input when prompted, or modify the code to pass custom parameters.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I should be comfortable defining and using functions that return values.
This is a powerful technique for building modular, reusable code and is a key aspect of more complex programming tasks.
I will be able to perform useful operations, such as converting units, finding factors, and merging lists efficiently.
Keep practicing and applying these concepts to more challenging tasks. üöÄ‚ú®
