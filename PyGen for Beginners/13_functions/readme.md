# Section 13: Functions üßë‚Äçüíª

Welcome to Section 13 of the course!
In this section, I will dive deep into user-defined functions in Python.
Functions are fundamental to structuring your code efficiently and solving various problems through modularity.
This section will introduce me to functions with and without parameters, the concept of local and global variables, and return value functions.

## Description üìù

This section consists of lessons covering the basics and advanced topics of functions.
Each lesson will guide me through creating functions for different purposes, such as performing calculations, drawing shapes, and solving real-world problems.
I'll also explore the concept of function return values, including those that return single and multiple values.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this section is to:

-   Teach me how to define and use functions, both with and without parameters.
-   Help me understand the concept of function return values, including single and multiple returns.
-   Improve my ability to solve practical problems using functions.
-   Develop a deeper understanding of local and global variables and their scope.

## How It Works üîç

-   **13_1_function_without_params**: Learn to define functions that do not require any parameters. I practice drawing geometric shapes using loops and functions, and understand the utility of functions without parameters.
-   **13_2_functions_with_params**: Explore how functions can accept input values (parameters) and use them for operations. I'll tackle problems like printing initials, drawing shapes, and calculating the sum of digits using parameters.

-   **13_3_local_and_global_variables**: This lesson introduces local and global variables, explaining the concept of scope and how variables behave in different parts of a program. No practical tasks are included, but it's essential for understanding how variables work within functions.

-   **13_4_return_value_functions**: Learn how functions can return results that can be further used in your code. I'll work on solving tasks like calculating distances, counting factors, and merging lists using functions with return values. There are 7 practical tasks in this lesson.

-   **13_5_return_value_functions**: This lesson builds upon the previous one, focusing on functions that return values such as numbers, booleans, or strings. I will solve tasks involving prime numbers, password validation, and string manipulations with return value functions. It includes 9 practical tasks.

-   **13_6_return_value_functions (Multiple Values)**: Explore functions that return multiple values, which are useful for solving complex problems such as geometry, physics, and algebra. In this lesson, I tackle problems that involve calculating midpoints, circle properties, and solving quadratic equations. It contains 3 practical tasks.

## Output üìú

Each task in this section will produce different outputs depending on the problem being solved.
Ensure me test my functions with various inputs to validate their behavior.

## Usage üì¶

1. Navigate to the task directory you want to explore.
2. Open the corresponding file and review or run the code.
3. Solve the tasks by implementing the required functions.
4. Test the solutions with different inputs to ensure correctness.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this section, I will have mastered creating and using functions to solve a wide variety of problems.
This will improve the structure of my code and help me tackle more complex tasks in the future.
Happy coding!
