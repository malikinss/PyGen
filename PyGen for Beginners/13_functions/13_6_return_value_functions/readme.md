# Lesson 13.6: Functions with Return Values (Multiple Values) üîÑ

## Description üìù

In this lesson, I will explore functions that return multiple values.
These functions are useful in situations where need to compute more than one result from a single function call.
I will learn how to define functions that return more than one value, and see practical examples of how to use these functions for solving problems in geometry, physics, and algebra.

## Purpose üéØ

-   **Multiple Return Values**: Learn how to define functions that return multiple values at once.
-   **Practical Applications**: Understand how functions that return multiple values can be used to solve real-world problems, such as calculating midpoints, circle properties, and solving quadratic equations.
-   **Improved Functionality**: Gain the ability to return more complex outputs from your functions, which can be especially helpful in mathematical, graphical, and engineering tasks.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, I will write functions that perform specific tasks and return multiple values.
For example, instead of returning just one result, I will return two or more pieces of information, such as coordinates, lengths, or results of calculations.
I will practice with geometric calculations (such as finding the midpoint of a line or the area and circumference of a circle) and solving quadratic equations.

## Tasks üìú

### 13_6_1 Midpoint of a Line Segment

This Python program calculates the midpoint of a line segment defined by two endpoints, given their coordinates.
The midpoint is the point exactly halfway between the two endpoints.

### 13_6_2 Circle Calculations

This Python program calculates two important properties of a circle: the **circumference** (the length around the circle) and the **area** (the space inside the circle) given its **radius**.
These calculations are based on the mathematical formulas for circumference \( C = 2\pi r \) and area \( A = \pi r^2 \).

### 13_6_3 Quadratic Equation Solver

This Python program solves a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are coefficients provided by the user.
The roots of the equation are found using the discriminant formula, and the results are returned in ascending order.

## Usage üì¶

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `13_6_return_value_functions` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 13_6_1_get_middle_point.py
    python 13_6_2_get_circle.py
    python 13_6_3_solve.py
    ```
4. Provide the necessary input when prompted or modify the code to pass custom parameters.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By the end of this lesson, I should be comfortable with defining functions that return multiple values.
These types of functions enhance the flexibility and power of my code by allowing me to handle more complex outputs in a single function call.
I'll keep practicing with real-world examples to get more familiar with returning and using multiple values in my functions. üöÄ‚ú®
