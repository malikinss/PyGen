# Circle Calculations 🎯

## Description 📝

This program calculates two important properties of a circle: the **circumference** (the length around the circle) and the **area** (the space inside the circle) given its **radius**.
The calculations are based on the mathematical formulas for these properties.

## Purpose 🎯

The function `get_circle()` is designed to calculate both the circumference and area of a circle using the provided radius. These calculations are fundamental in geometry and physics.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Function `get_circle(radius)`**:
    - It takes the radius of the circle as an argument.
    - **Circumference formula**:
      \[
      C = 2 \pi r
      \]
      where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
    - **Area formula**:
      \[
      A = \pi r^2
      \]
      where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
    - The function returns a tuple containing the circumference and the area of the circle.

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., `circle_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the script by executing:
    ```bash
    python circle_calculator.py
    ```
5. Enter the radius of the circle:
    - Example:
        ```
        5
        ```
6. The program will output the circumference and area of the circle:
    ```
    Circumference: 31.41592653589793, Area: 78.53981633974483
    ```

## Conclusion 🚀

This program provides an easy and quick way to compute the circumference and area of a circle given its radius.
It demonstrates the practical use of mathematical formulas in programming.
