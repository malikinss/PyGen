# Lesson 13.1: User-defined Functions Without Parameters 🧑‍💻

## Description 📝

This lesson focuses on creating user-defined functions in Python that do not take any parameters.
The lesson will cover basic concepts like using functions without parameters, the advantages of using functions, and the use of the `pass` keyword in Python.
Additionally, I will solve two problems that demonstrate how to draw geometric shapes using functions.

## Purpose 🎯

-   **Understanding Functions Without Parameters**: This lesson aims to reinforce the concept of defining and using functions that do not require parameters.
-   **Reusability and Simplicity**: Emphasize the advantages of using functions for code reusability, simplification, and organization.
-   **Introduction to `pass`**: Introduce the `pass` keyword, which is used to define a placeholder for future code.
-   **Practical Problem-Solving**: Solve problems that involve drawing shapes in the console using loops and functions.

## How It Works 🔍

In this lesson, I'll learn how to create functions that do not require any input from the user (no parameters).
The lesson involves two tasks where I'll draw geometric shapes (a rectangular box and a right triangle) using functions without parameters.
Each task will involve looping structures and basic control flow.

## Tasks 📜

### 13_1_1 Draw Box

This Python program draws a rectangular box made of stars.
The box has 14 rows and 10 columns.
The top and bottom rows are filled with stars (`*`), while the middle rows have stars on the edges and spaces inside, forming a hollow box.

### 13_1_2 Draw Triangle

This Python program draws a right triangle made of stars (`*`).
The triangle has 10 rows, with the first row containing 1 star, the second row containing 2 stars, and so on, until the 10th row which contains 10 stars.
The shape formed is a right triangle where both legs have a length of 10.

## Usage 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the `13_1_function_without_params` directory.
3. Run each script individually:
    ```bash
    python 13_1_1_draw_box.py
    python 13_1_2_draw_triangle.py
    ```
4. Observe the output in the terminal, where each script will display the corresponding shape.

## Conclusion 🚀

By the end of this lesson, I should be able to define and use user-defined functions without parameters.
This is a crucial step in organizing my code and breaking down complex tasks into simpler, reusable components.
Understanding the concept of `pass` and functions without parameters will help me write more modular and maintainable code.
Keep practicing these concepts with more complex tasks to further enhance skills. 🚀✨
