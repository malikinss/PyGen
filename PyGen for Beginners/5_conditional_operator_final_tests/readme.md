# Section 5: Conditional Operators - Final Tests ⚖️🧪

Welcome to Section 5 of the course!
This section is dedicated to final tests that will assess my understanding of conditional operators. 
I'll apply the knowledge gained in previous lessons to solve complex conditional problems.

## Description 📝
This section contains a final set of tasks focused on conditional operators. 
The problems are designed to test my ability to implement decision-making structures in a variety of scenarios.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this section is to evaluate my proficiency with conditional operators, including simple conditions, logical operations, and nested structures.
Successfully completing these tasks will demonstrate my ability to handle complex decision-making in my programs.

## How It Works 🔍
- **5_1_condition_tasks**: This set of tasks challenges me to solve problems using the conditional logic learned in previous sections.
Each task will require careful thought and testing to ensure that the conditions are handled correctly.

## Output 📜
The output for these tasks will vary depending on the specific conditions and inputs used.
Ensure that my solutions behave as expected across different scenarios.

## Usage 📦
1. Navigate to the `5_1_condition_tasks` directory.
2. Open the relevant files to review or execute the code.
3. Solve the tasks based on the provided problem descriptions, ensuring that your solutions cover all possible conditions.

## Conclusion 🚀
This final test will solidify my understanding of conditional operators. 
By completing these tasks, I'll be ready to tackle more advanced programming challenges that require complex decision-making logic.
