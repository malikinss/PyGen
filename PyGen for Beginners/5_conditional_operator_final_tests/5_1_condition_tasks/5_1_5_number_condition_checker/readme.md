# Number Condition Checker

## Description 📝
This Python program takes an integer as input and determines whether to output "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions related to the number's parity and value.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to classify a number based on its properties and provide a simple output based on defined rules.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - The program evaluates the number based on the following conditions:
     - If the number is odd, it outputs "YES".
     - If the number is even and in the range from 2 to 5 (inclusive), it outputs "NO".
     - If the number is even and in the range from 6 to 20 (inclusive), it outputs "YES".
     - If the number is even and greater than 20, it outputs "NO".
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the appropriate response based on the evaluated conditions.

## Output 📜
The output can be one of the following:
- "YES" for odd numbers.
- "NO" for even numbers in the range from 2 to 5 or greater than 20.
- "YES" for even numbers in the range from 6 to 20.

### Example:
For input: `3`
The output will be: `YES`

## Usage 📦
1. Save the code in a file named `5_1_5_number_condition_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. Run the script using the command:
   `python 5_1_5_number_condition_checker.py`
5. Enter the integer when prompted.

## Conclusion 🚀
This program is a straightforward tool for determining the output based on the parity and range of an input number, making it useful for basic programming practice and understanding conditional statements.
