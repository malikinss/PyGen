# Integer to Roman Numeral Converter

## Description 📝
This Python program reads an integer between 1 and 10 and converts it to its corresponding Roman numeral.
If the input number is outside this range, the program outputs an error message.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this program is to provide a simple conversion tool for integers to Roman numerals, specifically focusing on numbers from 1 to 10.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Conversion Logic**:
   - The program checks the input number and matches it to the corresponding Roman numeral.
3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the Roman numeral if the number is within the valid range.
   - If the number is outside the range, it outputs an error message.

## Output 📜
The output can be one of the following:
- Roman numeral representation for integers from 1 to 10:
  - 1 -> I
  - 2 -> II
  - 3 -> III
  - 4 -> IV
  - 5 -> V
  - 6 -> VI
  - 7 -> VII
