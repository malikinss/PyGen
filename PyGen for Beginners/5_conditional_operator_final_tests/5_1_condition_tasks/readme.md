# Lesson 5.1: Condition Tasks 🎯

## Description 📝
This lesson presents a series of tasks that focus on decision-making and condition evaluation.
These tasks require me to check specific conditions and perform actions based on the results.

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this lesson is to strengthen my understanding of conditional logic, particularly in real-world scenarios such as chessboard movements, number conversions, and eligibility checks.

## How It Works 🔍
In this lesson, I will:
- Implement various condition-based programs that check multiple criteria and provide specific outputs.
- Practice logical thinking by solving problems that require conditions to be verified before actions are taken.

## Tasks 📜
### 5.1.1 Year Ending in Two Zeros
This Python program checks if a given year ends in two zeros.

### 5.1.2 Chessboard Cell Color Checker
This Python program checks if two given cells on a chessboard have the same color.

### 5.1.3 Football Team Applicant Checker
This Python program evaluates whether an applicant is suitable for joining a football team based on their age and gender.

### 5.1.4 Integer to Roman Converter
This Python program reads an integer between 1 and 10 and converts it to its corresponding Roman numeral.

### 5.1.5 Number Condition Checker
This Python program takes an integer as input and determines whether to output "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions related to the number's parity and value.

### 5.1.6 Bishop Move Checker
This Python program determines whether a bishop can move from one cell to another on a chessboard in a single move.

### 5.1.7 Knight Move Checker
This Python program determines whether a knight can move from one cell to another on a chessboard in a single move.

### 5.1.8 Queen Move Checker
This Python program determines whether a queen can move from one cell to another on a chessboard in a single move.

## Conclusion 🚀
This chapter helps me refine my skills in applying conditional logic to solve various problems, from chessboard movements to number conversions. 
Mastering these concepts will greatly improve my decision-making abilities in programming.
