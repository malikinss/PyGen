# Code Review Task 15 🪲

## Description 📝

This task updates a Python script to replace all occurrences of the letter `"o"` in the string with the character `"@"`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to:

1. Demonstrate the use of the `replace()` method in Python for string manipulation.
2. Provide an example of replacing specific characters in a string.
3. Output the modified string with replacements.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program defines a string `s`.
-   It applies the `replace("o", "@")` method to replace all occurrences of `"o"` with `"@"`.
-   The transformed string is printed to the console.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs the modified string:  
    `"Pyth@n r@cks!"`

## Identified Errors in the Original Code 🕵🏾:

1. **Character replacement**:
    - Original: Missing implementation to replace `"o"` with `"@"`.
    - Fix: Used the `replace("o", "@")` method to modify the string.

## Fixed Code 🛠:

```python
# Define the string
s = 'Python rocks!'

# Replace 'o' with '@'
res = s.replace("o", "@")

# Print the result
print(res)
# Outputs: Pyth@n r@cks!
```

## Explanation of Changes 🧾:

1. **Applied `replace()` method**: The `replace()` function was used to locate and replace every "o" with "@".
2. **Output clarity**: The transformed string is printed directly to the console for verification.

## Conclusion 🚀

This task showcases the use of the `replace()` method for targeted string modifications, highlighting its utility for text processing in Python.
