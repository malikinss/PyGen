# Code Review Task🪲

## Description 📝

This task updates a Python script to calculate and display the length of a string using the built-in `len()` function.
The program processes the string: `"Python rocks!"` and outputs its length.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to:

1. Demonstrate the usage of the `len()` function for string length calculation.
2. Provide a concise and efficient solution for determining string lengths.
3. Output the length of the given string to the user.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program defines a string `s` with a specific value.
-   The `len()` function is applied to the string to calculate its length.
-   The result is stored in a variable `res` and printed to the console.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs the length of the string:  
    `13`

## Identified Errors in the Original Code 🕵🏾:

1. **Missing `len()` function**:

    - Original: `print()`
    - Issue: No function or method is applied to calculate the string length.
    - Fix: Use the `len()` function to determine the length of the string.

2. **Unclear Output**:
    - Original code lacks clarity in how the string length is derived.
    - Fix: Introduce a variable `res` to store and output the calculated length.

## Fixed Code 🛠:

```python
# Define the string
s = 'Python rocks!'

# Calculate the length of the string
res = len(s)

# Output the result
print(res)
# Outputs: 13
```

## Explanation of Changes 🧾:

1. **Applied `len()` function**: Used Python's built-in `len()` to calculate the string length.
2. **Defined result variable**: Stored the length in `res` for better code readability.
3. **Output clarity**: Explicitly printed the result, ensuring clear and accurate output.

## Conclusion 🚀

This task demonstrates the use of the `len()` function for string length calculation.
By completing the missing code, the script now correctly outputs the length of the given string.
