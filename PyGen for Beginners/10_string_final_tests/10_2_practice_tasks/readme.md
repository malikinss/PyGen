# Lesson 10.2: String Final Test Practice Tasks üìù

## Description üìù

This lesson consists of a series of practice tasks designed to reinforce string manipulation skills.
The tasks involve common string operations such as accessing characters, slicing, replacing characters, and manipulating string case.
These tasks are essential for mastering string handling in Python, and they provide hands-on practice for using string methods and techniques.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of these tasks is to help learners consolidate their knowledge of string manipulation, including:

-   Using string methods for case conversion and cleaning.
-   Slicing and accessing specific parts of a string.
-   Replacing characters and performing other common string operations.
    By the end of this lesson, learners will be proficient in applying various string operations in Python.

## How It Works üîç

In this lesson, you will:

-   Practice modifying strings using various methods and techniques.
-   Implement tasks that demonstrate the power and flexibility of string manipulation.
-   Solve problems that require efficient handling of string data.

## Tasks üìú

### 10.2.1 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to calculate and display the length of a string using the built-in `len()` function.

### 10.2.2 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to output the fourth character of a given string.

### 10.2.3 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to output characters from the 2nd to the 5th position (inclusive) of a given string.

### 10.2.4 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from a given string using the `strip()` method.

### 10.2.5 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to convert a string to uppercase using the `upper()` method.

### 10.2.6 Code Review Task

-   Updates a Python script to replace all occurrences of the letter `"o"` with `"@"` using the `replace()` method.

### 10.2.7 Remove Multiple of Three

-   Removes characters from a string at indices that are multiples of 3 (e.g., 0, 3, 6) using list comprehension and the `enumerate()` function.

### 10.2.8 Replace Ones with Word

-   Replaces all occurrences of the digit `'1'` with the word `"one"` in a given string.

### 10.2.9 Remove `@` Symbol

-   Removes all occurrences of the `'@'` symbol from a given string.

### 10.2.10 Find Second Occurrence of 'f'

-   Finds the index of the second occurrence of the letter `'f'` in a string, returning `-1` if it occurs once and `-2` if it doesn't occur at all.

### 10.2.11 Reverse Between 'h'

-   Reverses the characters between the first and last occurrences of the letter `'h'` in a string while keeping the rest of the string unchanged.

## Conclusion üöÄ

By completing these tasks, learners will have a comprehensive understanding of Python string methods and manipulation techniques.
These tasks help build a solid foundation for real-world string processing scenarios, preparing learners for more advanced tasks involving text data.
