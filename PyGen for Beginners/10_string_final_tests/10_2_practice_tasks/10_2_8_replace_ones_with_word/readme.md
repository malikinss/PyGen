# Replace '1' with 'one' 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a string as input and replaces all occurrences of the digit `'1'` with the word `"one"`.

## Purpose 🎯

The program demonstrates how to use a function for text processing, specifically for replacing characters in a string with another string.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `replace_ones_with_word()` processes the input text.
2. It uses the `replace()` method to substitute every instance of `'1'` with `"one"`.
3. The modified string is printed as the output.

## Output 📜

### Example Input:

Room 101 has 11 chairs.

### Example Output:

Room one0one has oneone chairs.

## Usage 📦

1. Save the script as `replace_ones.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter a string containing the digit `'1'` when prompted.
4. View the modified string in the console.

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal or Python IDE.
2. Execute the script using `python replace_ones.py`.
3. Provide a string input that includes the digit `'1'`.
4. The program will output the modified string with the replacements.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a practical example of string replacement and function usage in Python, ideal for learning about string manipulation and improving code reusability.
