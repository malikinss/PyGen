# Code Review Task 🪲

## Description 📝

This task updates a Python script to output characters from the 2nd to the 5th position (inclusive) of a given string:  
`"Python rocks!"`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to:

1. Demonstrate the use of slicing in strings to extract a specific range of characters.
2. Output the substring starting at the 2nd character and ending at the 5th character.
3. Provide an example of string manipulation using slices in Python.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program defines a string `s` with the value `"Python rocks!"`.
-   Using slicing (`s[1:5]`), a substring from the 2nd to the 5th character (inclusive) is extracted.
-   The program then prints the resulting substring to the console.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs the substring:  
    `"ytho"`

## Identified Errors in the Original Code 🕵🏾:

1. **Missing slicing operation**:
    - Original: Missing slicing operation to extract the required characters.
    - Fix: Added `s[1:5]` to extract the desired substring.

## Fixed Code 🛠:

```python
# Define the string
s = 'Python rocks!'

# Extract and print characters from the 2nd to the 5th position
print(s[1:5])
# Outputs: ytho
```

## Explanation of Changes 🧾:

1. **Slicing applied**: Used `s[1:5]` to extract the substring starting at the 2nd character and ending at the 5th character.
2. **Output clarity**: Printed the resulting substring directly to the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This task illustrates how to use slicing in Python strings effectively.
The updated script now correctly extracts and outputs the desired substring.
