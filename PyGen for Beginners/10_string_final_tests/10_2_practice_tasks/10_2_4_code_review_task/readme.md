# Code Review Task 🪲

## Description 📝

This task updates a Python script to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from a given string:  
`"    Python rocks!     "`.

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this program is to:

1. Demonstrate the use of the `strip()` method in Python to clean up whitespace.
2. Output the trimmed version of the string without leading or trailing spaces.
3. Provide an example of efficient whitespace removal in string manipulation.

## How It Works 🔍

-   The program defines a string `s` with leading and trailing spaces.
-   It applies the `strip()` method to remove the extra whitespace.
-   The program then prints the cleaned-up string to the console.

## Output 📜

-   The program outputs the trimmed string:  
    `"Python rocks!"`

## Identified Errors in the Original Code 🕵🏾:

1. **Whitespace handling**:
    - Original: Missing implementation to remove leading and trailing spaces.
    - Fix: Used the `strip()` method to clean up the string.

## Fixed Code 🛠:

```python
# Define the string with leading and trailing spaces
s = '    Python rocks!     '

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace
res = s.strip()

# Print the trimmed string
print(res)
# Outputs: Python rocks!
```

## Explanation of Changes 🧾:

1. **Applied `strip()` method**: The `strip()` function was used to remove unwanted leading and trailing spaces.
2. **Output clarity**: The cleaned-up string is printed directly to the console.

## Conclusion 🚀

This task effectively showcases the use of the `strip()` method to handle unnecessary whitespace in strings, resulting in a cleaner and more readable output.
