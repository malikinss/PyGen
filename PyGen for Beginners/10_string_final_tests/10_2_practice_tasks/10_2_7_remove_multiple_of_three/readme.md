# Remove Characters at Indices Multiple of 3 📝

## Description 📝

This Python program takes a string as input and removes all characters whose indices are multiples of 3 (e.g., 0, 3, 6, etc.).

## Purpose 🎯

The program is designed to demonstrate basic string manipulation using Python, showcasing the use of list comprehension and the `enumerate()` function for filtering specific indices in a string.

## How It Works 🔍

1. The function `remove_multiple_of_three()` processes the input string.
2. It uses list comprehension combined with `enumerate()` to iterate over the string.
3. Characters at indices that are **not multiples of 3** are included in the result.
4. The modified string is returned and printed.

## Output 📜

### Example Input:

abcdefg

### Example Output:

bdfg

## Usage 📦

1. Copy the script into your Python environment.
2. Run the script.
3. Provide a string input when prompted.
4. View the result printed to the console.

### Steps:

1. Save the script as `remove_chars.py`.
2. Open a terminal or Python IDE.
3. Execute the script with `python remove_chars.py`.
4. Input your text and see the modified string.

## Conclusion 🚀

This program is a simple yet effective example of text processing in Python, demonstrating list comprehensions and string handling.
